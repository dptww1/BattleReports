<h1>Old Cotton's Farm</h1>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<p class="initialCap">My playthrough of the <i>Scouring of the Shire</i> (2019 version) scenarios
for Games Workshop's <i>Middle Earth Strategy Battle Game</i> continues here with Old Cotton's Farm.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Here the titular farmer must defend his turf against Rowan Thistlewood and the usual
band of Ruffians.  Fortunately for Cotton, Frodo, Sam,and Merry have returned from their journey to help
raise the Shire against Sharkey's Men, and the Ruffians find more than they bargained for.</p>

<p class="initialCap">To win, Good has to reduce the Ruffians to 25% or less (i.e. three models) while Evil
has to slay four of the five(!) Good heroes in this scenario.  Ties are possible if both conditions happen
on the same turn.</p>

<h3>The Forces</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_1692.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1692.JPG" alt="Good Forces" title="Good Forces" width="250" height="188"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_1693.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1693.JPG" alt="Evil Forces" title="Evil Forces" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">The Good force is about the same size as usual for the Scouring scenarios, but the mix of model types is very different.
Six hobbit Militia (middle row) are accompanied by four Archers (back row) and five heroes (front row, from left to right): Frodo, Sam,
Merry, Farmer Cotton, and Hamfast Gamgee (Sam's old Gaffer).  In my <a href="../LotR-20191218/">last scenario</a> I used a substitute Gaffer because it looked like GW had
moved on from this supplement in favor of <i>War in Rohan</i> (which looks fabuluous), but days after I posted that playthrough GW announced the real Gaffer
was available for pre-order.  I guess I should have been more patient.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Arrayed against the hobbits are Rowan Thistlewood and the usual band of twelve Ruffians.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Ruffians have their usual combat advantage of higher Fight values and the scenario-specific rule that they re-roll '1's to Wound.  But
Might-wise the Good side musters eight points to Evil's one, so I expect we'll see a lot of more heroism from Good side than from Evil.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Setup</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_1694.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1694.JPG" alt="Setup" title="Setup" width="250" height="188"></a>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">As with many of the smaller figure count scenarios, this one takes place on a 2'x2' board, with four hobbit holes placed around
the middle.  The need to construct two more hobbit holes (along with the holidays and getting the real Gaffer painted) is the reason for the delay between
this replay and the last one.  The newer hobbit holes (with the stonework porches) are based on the Forgeworld kits and take up a lot of space.  I might
have made mine too big, as the board is very crowded.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Farmer Cotton sets up by his lonesome near the south edge of the board.  The Ruffians start in the middle, and the remaining hobbits
are divided into two equal groups (led by Frodo and Merry to the west and Sam and the Gaffer to the east) and must set up at least 3&quot; away from the Ruffians.
Since there's a scenario-specific rule in place that hobbits must Charge if they are able, they deploy over 4&quot; away so they retain their freedom
of movement and can threaten to throw stones if the Ruffians don't budge.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Gaffer deploys his flower pots around the center where the fighting is likely to be. Recall the hobbits within 4&quot; of a flower
pot re-roll '1's to Wound.  Since Evil also rerolls '1's to Wound due to that scenario special rule, and Rowan and Frodo act as banners, there's a lot of
re-rolling in this scenario.</p>

<h3>Turn 1</h3>

<p>
</p>

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">As always in narrative play, Good starts with Priority.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Which Good doesn't want; he'd prefer to see what
the Ruffians are up to.  So he stays put and readies his missiles,
except for the exposed Farmer Cotton, who runs west to hide behind a
hobbit hole.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil sends two Ruffians after him, then decides to rush East (last image; the camera has turned 90Â° counter-clockwise) though the archers nock their
arrows instead.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Shooting sees a hobbit Archer killing a Ruffian (top of the last image).  Evil return fire is ineffective, though Cotton is lucky he hid because
an arrow hits the hobbit hole instead of him.</p>

<p class="initialCap">There are three Combats this turn.  Evil gets off to a great start as the Ruffian fighting the Gaffer put a Wound on the old hobbit.  But then Good
wins the other two Combats, with Sam failing to Wound but the random Militia scoring a kill.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Casualties: Good 0, Evil 2</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 2</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_1720.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1720.JPG" alt="Turn 2, Cotton" title="Turn 2, Cotton" width="250" height="188"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_1719.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1719.JPG" alt="Turn 2, Main Action" title="Turn 2, Main Action" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 3-1.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Relatively awash with Might, Sam and Farmer Cotton call Heroic Moves.  Rowan, with the only Evil Might point in the game, decides to let them
have it.  So Cotton leads his pursuers on a merry chase, while Sam and his gang rush the Ruffians.  The Ruffians then continue their plan from last turn, and lastly
Frodo and Merry's group finally gets into motion, less the two archers, who still have targets.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Shooting has no effect this turn.</p>

<p class="initialCap">There are again three Combats.  Luck runs to Evil as the outnumbered Ruffian facing the Gaffer fends off his attackers, the
other lone Ruffian slays a hobbit Archer, and Sam has walked into a meat grinder as Rowan inflicts two Wounds (the red beads are missing in the image,
unfortunately) and the hobbit is forced to use all three Fate points to survive!</p>

<p class="initialCap">Casualties: Good 1, Evil 2</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 3</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_1722.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1722.JPG" alt="Turn 3, Cotton" title="Turn 3, Cotton" width="250" height="188"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_1723.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1723.JPG" alt="Turn 3, Main Action" title="Turn 3, Main Action" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 5-3.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Gaffer calls a Heroic Move, and again Rowan lets it slide.  The hobbits Charge where they can and likewise Evil
counter-Charges.  The bottleneck between the hobbit holes makes it difficult for either side to use their numbers effectively.  Somewhat ironically,
the only model on the board who could lend spear support -- helpful in situations like this -- is Cotton, and he's miles (well, feet) away from anyone
he could possibly assist.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Merry and Frodo both roll '1's trying to cross the fence but the two Militia just make it over.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Shooting is again ineffective.</p>

<p class="initialCap">In Combat, Cotton is outnumbered and takes a Wound which is saved by Fate.  Elsewhere Good wins every other combat -- including
a lone Militia against a Ruffian and Rowan, where Rowan declines to use his Might point to win.  But the lack of red beads in the last image is not
a mistake this turn, as, despite the re-rolls granted by the nearby flowerpots, not a single Wound is scored!  These hobbits really are loathe to kill.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Casualties: Good 1, Evil 2</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 4</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_1726.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1726.JPG" alt="Turn 4, Cotton" title="Turn 4, Cotton" width="250" height="188"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_1725.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1725.JPG" alt="Turn 4, Main Action" title="Turn 4, Main Action" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 5-2.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Rowan again hangs on to his Might point.</p>

<p class="initialCap">There's the usual Charge and counter-Charge.  Note in the first image that Cotton ran away with the idea that by getting around
the corner he'd face a single Ruffian instead of two.  But that's illegal, as hobbits are supposed to Charge if they can.  I didn't catch it in the heat
of the moment, though.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Frodo again rolls a '1' and can't cross the fence.  He's can't voluntarily fight anyway, but it'd be nice to extend his 6&quot;
banner range over to Sam's group, which is clearly having trouble.</p>

<p class="initialCap">There no Shooting as all the Ruffians are engaged.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Combat is much bloodier this turn.  The Gaffer takes a second Wound and he's only saved by using his last Fate point.  Elsewhere,
Merry manages to take down another Ruffian but three hobbit Militia are lost in return.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Casualties: Good 4, Evil 3</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 5</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_1728.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1728.JPG" alt="Turn 5, Cotton" title="Turn 5, Cotton" width="250" height="188"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_1729.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1729.JPG" alt="Turn 5, Main Action" title="Turn 5, Main Action" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 5-3.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The status quo is favoring Evil, so Rowan holds onto his Might yet again. As the hobbits must Charge, things are devolving
into a huge scrum.  Frodo <i>again</i> rolls a '1' and can't cross the fence.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Despite being outnumbered, Cotton wins his Combat and takes out one of his attackers! Merry also rises to the occasion and
despite facing three Ruffians, he wins his Combat and, with a Might point, dispatches two opponents.  Likewise Sam, who takes out his opponent, too.</p>

<p class="initialCap">In return, only Rowan manages to slay a hobbit.  Is the tide turning against Evil?  Although several Good Heroes are nearing death,
none have actually fallen, and all Good needs to win is to take out three more Ruffians...</p>

<p class="initialCap">Casualties: Good 5, Evil 7</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 6</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_1732.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1732.JPG" alt="Turn 5, Cotton" title="Turn 5, Cotton" width="250" height="188"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_1731.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1731.JPG" alt="Turn 5, Main Action" title="Turn 5, Main Action" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 6-3.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The hobbits Charge.  Merry moves to take down Rowan, but is counter-Charged by a Ruffian.  Frodo <i>again</i> rolls a '1' --
fourth turn in row! -- and can't cross the fence.</p>

<p class="initialCap">As if to make up for last turn, Combat favors Evil.  Though one Ruffian is killed thanks to a flower pot re-roll, a Militia goes
down, too, and Rowan continues his kill streak by taking out Sam!</p>

<p class="initialCap">Casualties: Good 7 (incl. 1 Hero), Evil 8</p>


<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 7</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_1734.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1734.JPG" alt="Turn 5, Cotton" title="Turn 5, Cotton" width="250" height="188"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_1735.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1735.JPG" alt="Turn 5, Main Action" title="Turn 5, Main Action" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 2-1.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Everyone Charges.  Frodo finally clears the fence, just barely.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Merry, assured of fighting Rowan this turn, calls a Heroic Strike with his last Might point, which Rowan is unable to counter.
Both sides get their '6' in the subsequent Combat and Merry takes it on his increased Fight value!  But despite eight strikes on the Evil hero,
only two Wounds are scored (red beads missing again) and Rowan is saved by his Fate point.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Elsewhere two Militia take out another Ruffian but in return the Gaffer goes down to the blows of a couple of bullies.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Casualties: Good 8 (incl. 2 Heroes), Evil 9</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 8</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_1738.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1738.JPG" alt="Turn 5, Cotton" title="Turn 5, Cotton" width="250" height="188"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_1737.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1737.JPG" alt="Turn 5, Main Action" title="Turn 5, Main Action" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 1-1.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Ruffians engage nearby hobbits, freeing Rowan to seek out Frodo.  Only needing to inflict one more casualty, Merry forgoes
pursuing Rowan and instead moves to help a Militia against a regular Ruffian, a much softer target.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Cotton's luck finally runs out and the doughty hobbit is clubbed down.  That's three Heroes for Evil!  The ill-luck for Good
continues as the outnumbered Ruffian shrugs off Merry's attack and kills the Militia, and Rowan also takes out an attacker.</p>

<p class="initialCap">All that needs to end the game is one more Evil or Good Hero casualty.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Casualties: Good 9 (incl. 3 Heroes), Evil 9</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 9</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_1740.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1740.JPG" alt="Turn 9" title="Turn 9" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 5-1.</p>

<p class="initialCap">We don't need two pictures any more as the clubman is just moving at full speed trying to get back into the main action.
Rowan engages Frodo while the other two Ruffians also Charge the nearby hobbits.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Merry and his Militia buddy lose <i>again</i> -- perhaps the Might is not the only thing exhausted in Merry -- and there are
no casualties this turn, though Frodo does take a Wound from Rowan the fighting machine.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Casualties: Good 9 (incl. 3 Heroes), Evil 9</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 10</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_1742.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1742.JPG" alt="Turn 10" title="Turn 10" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 6-2.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Cotton's attacker is back in shot.  The Combats are a repeat of last turn in line-up if not in effect.</p>

<p class="initialCap">It looks like Merry will lose his Combat yet again as his Ruffian opponent's Duel roll is a '6'.  Fortunately, Merry gets
a '6', too, and his luck finally turns as Good wins the roll-off and down goes the Ruffian. Good victory!</p>

<p class="initialCap">Except Frodo is unable to fend off Rowan, who inflicts another Wound on Frodo.  His Fate roll is an unmightable '2',
and Frodo falls.  Evil victory!</p>

<p class="initialCap">Net result: tied game.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Post-game Thoughts</h3>

<p class="initialCap">Wow, what a game!  That was tremendously tense and fun.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Having hobbits with some real power was a nice change of pace in this scenario.  Despite his sometimes poor dierolling,
Merry is every bit the equal of the Sharkey's Rogues heroes.</p>

<p class="initialCap">I don't think I played the Good side particularly well.  Relying on Shooting rather than just getting stuck in from the
beginning is probably suboptimal. And Frodo and Merry needed to be in the main action much earlier; they are arguably the most important pieces
on the Good side.  Although I think Merry used his Might points well given the decisions made earlier in this game, starting off with a Heroic March
or two might have been even better to get Sam and company in Frodo's banner range.  Assuming Frodo could cross the fence, of course.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Cotton probably shouldn't have run off by himself even if he nearly did take out his pair of attackers.  I think given
Frodo's 6&quot; banner effect and Cotton's support ability that Good wants everyone together in one big scrum.</p>

<p class="initialCap">I'm not sure what else Evil could have done.  It's mildly amusing that Rowan never spent his Might point because he
never really needed to.  As it was he killed Sam and Frodo along with another three hobbit warriors, inflicting about half of Good's
casualties single-handed!</p>

<p class="initialCap">Great scenario.</p>
