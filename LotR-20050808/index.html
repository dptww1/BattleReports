<h1>Flight to the Ferry</h1>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<p class="initialCap">This scenario for Games Workshop's <em>Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle
Game</em> was a solo endeavor.  I wanted to get a feel for the scenario before trying it out with my kids.
The scenery is complete but the models are not; I think given the limits of my photography that the latter
isn't too distracting.</p>

<p class="initialCap">I used the scenario from <em>Battle Games in Middle Earth</em> magazine #37,
which differs from the version on the GW website (no longer available).  The BGiME gives a stone-throwing ability
to the Good player which makes for slightly more interesting decision making, and the Evil lineup is different.</p>

<h3>Cast of Characters</h3>

<p><a href="Images/thIMG_1253.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1253.jpg" alt="Good Models" title="Good models"></a></p>

<p><a href="Images/thIMG_1254.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1254.jpg" alt="Evil Models" title="Evil models"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Here are our intrepid hobbits (in order): Sam, Frodo, Pippin, and Merry.
Their goal is to reach the Bucklebury Ferry on the opposite site of the table.  Despite what you see on the models,
the hobbits carry no weapons and so will be at a disadvantage in melee.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Against them is pitted one of the Ringwraiths on
horseback.  His speed advantage (10" move vs 4" for the hobbits) in the race to the Ferry is somewhat
mitigated by his need to spot the hobbits before he can move freely.  Until then, he gets only half movement
and he is controlled by whichever player has priority.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p><a href="Images/thIMG_1252.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1252.jpg" alt="Setup: Ferry View" title="Setup: Ferry View"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">The battlefield is heavily wooded and the line of sight rules are amended so
that you cannot see over a tree base even though you can physically see between the tree models.  To win, Good
must get all the hobbits safely onto the Ferry, Evil must slay Frodo and/or two of the other hobbits.  If just
Sam, Merry, or Pippin is killed, the game is a draw.  It's a long way to the Ferry at 4" per turn.</p>

<p class="initialCap">On with the game!</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->


<h3>Turns 1-3</h3>

<p><a href="Images/thIMG_1263.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1263.jpg" alt="Turns 1-3" title="Turns 1-3"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good gets priority on Turn 1. The hobbits dash for the Ferry and the Nazgul
dashes for the hobbits.  Good gets priority again on Turn 2.  The hobbits continue to run while the Ringwraith
(under Good control) retraces his steps.  Perhaps he dropped his wallet?</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil gets priority on turn 3.  The relative positions make it likely the
Nazgul will spot a halfling next turn, so brave Samwise lags behind a bit and throws a rock (the white token)
to distract the enemy.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 4</h3>

<p><a href="Images/thIMG_1265.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1265.jpg" alt="Turn 4" title="Turn 4"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil again wins priority but can't take advantage of it due to the need to
investigate that noise in the forest.  The hobbits examine the lines of sight and veer a bit south so as to
avoid the gaze of the Ringwraith.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turns 5-6</h3>

<p><a href="Images/thIMG_1268.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1268.jpg" alt="Turn 6: Overview" title="Turn 6: Overview"></a></p>

<p><a href="Images/thIMG_1270.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1270.jpg" alt="Turn 6: Spotted!" title="Turn 6: Spotted!"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Having found nothing, the Ringwraith doubles back to the forest edge and
spots the hobbits as they dash across the open fields.  Can they make it to the ferry safely?  They're pretty
close, but the Nazgul can now move his full 10".</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 7</h3>

<p><a href="Images/thIMG_1277.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1277.jpg" alt="Turn 7" title="Turn 7"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Winning priority, the Ringwraith gallops towards the fleeing hobbits.
They're too far away to melee, but the Nazgul uses his uncanny abilities to try to <em>Transfix</em> Sam.
Unfortunately, he rolls a '1' and is now down to 6 Will for no effect.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Well, no effect other than scaring the hobbits, who continue to run pell
mell to the Ferry.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 8</h3>

<p><a href="Images/thIMG_1280.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1280.jpg" alt="Turn 8: Overview" title="Turn 8: Overview"></a></p>

<p><a href="Images/thIMG_1282.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1282.jpg" alt="Turn 8: At the Ferry" title="Turn 8: At the Ferry"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good wins priority and Pippin and Merry jump onto the boat and unmoor it.
The other hobbits will have to take Jump tests to get on board, which is a bit risky but at least Frodo and
Sam have Might points to help them out.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Screaming with anger, the Ringwraith rides as close as he can to Frodo and
Sam and again tries to <em>Transfix</em> Sam, this time spending two Will points to make sure he succeeds.
But his powers fail him again (a 1/9 chance).</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 9</h3>

<p><a href="Images/thIMG_1285.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1285.jpg" alt="Turn 9: from the River" title="Turn 9: from the River"></a></p>

<p><a href="Images/thIMG_1286.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1286.jpg" alt="Turn 9: from the Bank" title="Turn 9: from the Bank"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil wins priority, but Sam expends his Might point and cries "With me!",
enabling he and Frodo to move before the Nazgul.  Both easily jump onto the Ferry and the Good player has won
the game.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The next river crossing is 20 miles up the road, Mr. Ringwraith.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Post-game Thoughts</h3>

<p class="initialCap">A quick-playing scenario.  Not a lot of meat, and the Ringwraith stands
almost no chance of winning, which makes it ideal for playing with the kids as the hobbits.  I solo'ed this
three more times, in one memorable game having unarmed Sam charge and kill the Ringwraith with his bare fists.
(Maybe he was packing a roll of quarters or something?)  There was no situation where it seemed likely that
the Ringwraith would win, although a draw seemed possible sometimes.</p>

<p class="initialCap">I've since decided that letting the Good player control the Ringwraith's
movement both through winning priority <em>and</em> throwing stones gives them too much advantage, so I now
omit the former rule.</p>
