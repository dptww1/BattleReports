<h1>Arrest of Folco Boffin</h1>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<p class="initialCap">Here's <i>The Arrest of Folco Boffin</i>, a scenario of Games Workshop's <i>Middle
Earth Strategy Battle Game</i> from the <i>Scouring of the Shire</i> (2019) sourcebook.  As you can tell
from the name, this is
<a href="../LotR-20191104/">Yet</a>
<a href="../LotR-20191005/">Another</a>
<a href="../LotR-20191020/">Arrest</a>
scenario, where Evil is trying to arrest you-can-guess-who and
exit him off the western board edge, while Good tries to get him off the same board edge under his own power.</p>

<p class="initialCap">This scenario is unusual because it's just hobbits against hobbits.  Because of this,
no one is willing to strike to kill.  Evil's Strikes turn into 50/50 chances of arresting (i.e. <i>Paralyzing</i>)
their victim.  Good's successful Strikes drive away their victims ... though in practical terms that's
indistinguishable from kills.  Sounds nicer, however.  There's no stone throwing here, either.</p>

<h3>The Forces</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_1645.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1645.JPG" alt="Good Forces" title="Good Forces" width="250" height="188"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_1646.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1646.JPG" alt="Evil Forces" title="Evil Forces" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">The Good forces are eight Hobbit Militia, led by Folco Boffin.  Trying to arrest him are Robin Smallburrow,
Holfoot Bracegirdle, and twelve Shirriffs.  Note that I've had to cheat and use four Archers (at the back) to fill out my
Shirriffs. But they're used here as Shirriffs, not Archers; the substitution does unfortunately amplify the problem of discerning who
is on which side in the pictures.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Setup</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_1647.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1647.JPG" alt="Setup" title="Setup" width="250" height="188"></a>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">The Good side begins within 3&quot; of the eastern board edge, with the Militia protecting Folco.  The
Evil side then sets up within 3&quot; of the western board edge.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 1</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_1649.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1649.JPG" alt="Turn 1" title="Turn 1" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">With no Shooting possible, both sides advance a full move.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 2</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_1651.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1651.JPG" alt="Turn 2" title="Turn 2" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 3-2.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil continues to march up, while Good manuevers to take advantage of the terrain.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 3</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_1653.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1653.JPG" alt="Turn 3" title="Turn 3" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 4-2.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Good advances, and Evil begins moving around the fence.  Now the game begins in earnest.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 4</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_1655.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1655.JPG" alt="Turn 4" title="Turn 4" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 5-5.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The general scrum begins but neither side's heart is apparently in it as there are no Evil casualties.
Two Militia are arrested but one immediately escapes.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Casualties: Good 1 arrested, Evil 0</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 5</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_1657.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1657.JPG" alt="Turn 5" title="Turn 5" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 6-1.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Good tries to push forward while still protecting Folco.  Evil countercharges.
Robin and the hobbit next to him are on the wrong side of the fence because they both rolled '1's on
their climb tests to cross it.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Combat starts getting serious with two more arrests and two Shirriffs "chased away" (ahem).  None of the
arrested hobbits escapes.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Casualties: Good 3 arrested, Evil 2</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 6</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_1659.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1659.JPG" alt="Turn 6" title="Turn 6" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 5-4.</p>

<p class="initialCap">This seems like a perfect opportunity for Holfoot to call a Heroic Move.  All the Shirriffs are within
his range and this lets the numerous Evil hobbits gang up on the Militia, and, with control zones negated, one Shirriff even
reaches Folco.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Combat favors Evil, and three more Militia are arrested.  Folco, too, is captured (his Fate roll fails)
but he immediately escapes.  He's the only one; still, if only one guy's is going to escape, Good wants it to be Folco.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Casualties: Good 6 arrested, Evil 2</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 7</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_1660.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1660.JPG" alt="Turn 7" title="Turn 7" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 4-1.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Folco is recaptured, as is another Militia.  One Militia wins against the Shirriffs but is unable to
score a Wound.  At the end of the turn, Folco escapes again(!), as do two nearby Militia (with the yellow beads).</p>

<p class="initialCap">From this turn on, I've started omitting the couple of Militia at the eastern edge of the fence to
better focus on the important action.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Casualties: Good 5 arrested, Evil 2</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 8</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_1662.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1662.JPG" alt="Turn 8" title="Turn 8" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 4-3.</p>

<p class="initialCap">It's Robin's turn to call a Heroic Move, after which there's no more Might on the board.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Folco loses his Combat again but none of the enemy Strikes can score above a 3+ and he remains free
yet another turn.  Elsewhere another Militia is arrested, and no one escapes.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Casualties: Good 6 arrested, Evil 2</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 9</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_1664.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1664.JPG" alt="Turn 9" title="Turn 9" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 5-4.</p>

<p class="initialCap">With decisive numerical superiority, all of the Good hobbits are arrested.  The Shirriffs, irritated
by how crowded the battlefield is, realize they can pick up the arrested hobbits.  So they do so and start dragging them
away from the path needed to get Folco off the board.  No one escapes.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Casualties: Good 9 arrested, Evil 2</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 10</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_1666.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1666.JPG" alt="Turn 10" title="Turn 10" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 4-2.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Priority doesn't really matter here because all the Good side is immobile!  The Shirriffs start dragging
Folco away.</p>

<p class="initialCap">And at this point the narrative concludes. I did play this out, but there was no miracle for the Good
side.  Sometimes a hobbit or two would escape -- never Folco, though -- but Evil had enough models to subdue them immediately
and on Turn 16 Folco was finally frogmarched off the board for an Evil Victory.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Post-game Thoughts</h3>

<p class="initialCap">Hmm.  That was not particularly satisfactory.</p>

<p class="initialCap">I think I can see how this is supposed to go.  Evil has the numbers, yeah, but Good casualties never
really entirely disappear.  So eventually, given a long enough game, Evil should get whittled down enough, perhaps enough
to let Folco exit the board.</p>

<p class="initialCap">But we sure didn't see that here, did we? After Turn 5, Good never succeeded in "Wounding" any
Evil models, despite sometimes winning battles.  So Evil's numbers quickly became overwhelming.  Combined with subpar
escape rolls, the result was that Good just got rolled.</p>

<p class="initialCap">I will never claim that my tactics are expert-level, so it's possible I'm missing something.
But looking over the tools available, it's hard to see how Good pulls this out without a lot of luck.  Evil has half again as
many troops, and they are of higher quality. Evil's heroes have Might points; Good's hero has none and is unarmed to boot.
So how is Good supposed to be competitive?</p>

<p class="initialCap">I wonder if giving Folco a Might point and/or reducing Evil to 8 Shirriffs (instead of 12) would
help here.</p>
