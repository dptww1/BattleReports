<h1>Maggot's Farm</h1>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<p class="initialCap">This LotR scenario is from the <i>Scouring of the
Shire</i> supplement.  It's one of the smallest published by GW: five Ruffians try
to reach Hobbiton across Farmer Maggot's land, while Maggot and his three dogs try to stop
them.  So only nine figures total, and only 1 Might point (Maggot's) between them.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The farmer himself begins the game off board, and until alerted
the dogs are moved by the Priority player a number of inches equal to his/her Priority roll.  So
it's possible for the Ruffians to exit peaceably if Evil wins Priority
early and often.  This isn't just a theoretical concern, as it occurred the first time
I tried to play this.  So this Battle Report actually documents my second playthrough</p>

<p class="initialCap">If the dogs do wake up, it's a situation not entirely
devoid of interest.  The stat lines for the dogs and the Ruffians are practically identical,
so things are even up there.  And though the dogs are outnumbered, they're faster (8" move vs 6")
and by scenario special rule they cause Terror.  Also when they wake up there's a 1/3 chance each
turn thereafter that Maggot will enter, bringing his two-handed scythe with him.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Besides numbers, the Ruffians' advantages include archery.  It's
a pretty slight edge, though, since there's only a single bowman and because of the scenario's
weather rule he only hits on a 6.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil wins by exiting three Ruffians off the Hobbiton edge of the board, opposite
where they enter. If two or less make it, Good wins.  No tie is possible.</p>

<h3>Setup &amp; Turn 1</h3>

<p><a href="Images/Img_2811.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thImg_2811.jpg" alt="Setup + Turn 1" title="Setup + Turn 1"></a></p>

<p><a href="Images/Img_2812.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thImg_2812.jpg" alt="Setup + Turn 1 Closeup" title="Setup + Turn 1 Closeup"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Only the dogs begin on board, within 6" of the scarecrow.  Good
spreads them out to maximize coverage -- he needs a dog within 6" of a Ruffian to end the patrol rules
and get Maggot on the board.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Good begins with Priority, but it's pretty much meaningless here since only
the Ruffians move on Turn 1, entering from the bottom edge.  They decide to stick together near a board edge
to lessen the likelihood of being caught.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 2</h3>

<p><a href="Images/Img_2813.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thImg_2813.jpg" alt="Turn 2" title="Turn 2"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 6-5.  This is the dream Priority roll for Evil, since he
gets to move the dogs 6".  Needless to say they hear some distraction in the other direction and over the fence.
Meanwhile, the Ruffians continue their dash for Hobbiton.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 3</h3>

<p><a href="Images/Img_2814.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thImg_2814.jpg" alt="Turn 3" title="Turn 3"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 1-1.  Which is the worst possible roll to undo the effects
of Evil's dog control last turn.  Still, every little bit helps.  The Ruffians continue their sprint.  The
bowman could shoot, but the dogs are far enough away and the chances of a kill are so small that he
elects to make a full move rather than risk alerting them this turn.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 4</h3>

<p><a href="Images/Img_2815.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thImg_2815.jpg" alt="Turn 4" title="Turn 4"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 5-3.  Good gets the dogs about to their starting positions.
With the Ruffians so far advanced now, it's likely that they'll activate the dogs next turn anyway, so while
his mates continue their sprint, the bowman hangs back a bit and takes his shot on Fang.  He fails to hit, so
the Good side is now alerted.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 5</h3>

<p><a href="Images/Img_2816.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thImg_2816.jpg" alt="Turn 5" title="Turn 5"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority.  One Ruffian charges Fang while the others scramble to the
fence.  Things start off poorly for Good, as his roll for Maggot's entry fails, Grip is too far away to enter
combat, and Wolf fails his Jump test and can't leave the cabbage patch.  But the combat phase finally sees things
turn around as Fang takes out his Ruffian foe.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 6</h3>

<p><a href="Images/Img_2817.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thImg_2817.jpg" alt="Turn 6" title="Turn 6"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority.  Maggot arrives and begins his slow (4"/turn) march into battle.
Perhaps spurred by the arrival of his master and/or his poor acrobatic performance last turn, Wolf rolls 6 on his
Jump test and rockets into combat with a Ruffian.  Fang charges also, while Grip moves to a blocking position.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Grip's move pays off as the Ruffians can't move without engaging him, and they
all fail their Courage tests and stand still.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Wolf's combat is inconclusive, but Fang's luck runs out and he is killed by his
Ruffian opponent.  (The photographer spared you the gore, as Fang is just out of the picture.)</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 7</h3>

<p><a href="Images/Img_2818.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thImg_2818.jpg" alt="Turn 7" title="Turn 7"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority.  The dogs are blocking three Ruffians, and unfortunately for
Evil only one passes his Courage test. The lone brave lad charges Grip.  At the other end of the fence, the bowman
climbs over.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Wolf moves to meet up with Farmer Maggot as a reserve.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Grip defeats his Ruffian, but his strike does not kill.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 8</h3>

<p><a href="Images/Img_2819.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thImg_2819.jpg" alt="Turn 8" title="Turn 8"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority.  Maggot's still too far away to attack, so if the two dogs engage
the Ruffians they have a decent chance of ending up outnumbered during Evil reaction to the move.  So the dogs
move to Maggot's side and bide their time.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Ruffians advance, the bowman holding back to take another potshot.  He
<i>just</i> misses, needing a 6,5 and rolling a 6,4.  Too bad warriors have no might!</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 9</h3>

<p><a href="Images/Img_2820.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thImg_2820.jpg" alt="Turn 9" title="Turn 9"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority.  Maggot's finally in Charge range and does so, with Grip along
to help.  Wolf moves to blocking position.  The Ruffians again fail their Courage tests; mitigating this bad luck
somewhat is that engaged Ruffian wins his combat ... but his strike does no damage.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 10</h3>

<p><a href="Images/Img_2821.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thImg_2821.jpg" alt="Turn 10" title="Turn 10"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority.  The Ruffians are getting close to the board edge and decide
to run for it.  Grip moves to block the head of the Ruffian conga line while Maggot and Wolf try to pick off an
enemy together.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Combat sees things go Evil's way, as Grip is killed by his opponent and
while Maggot and Wolf win their combat, their strikes do no damage (despite Maggot's +1 for a two-handed weapon
and possible Might point expenditure).</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 11</h3>

<p><a href="Images/Img_2823.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thImg_2823.jpg" alt="Turn 11" title="Turn 11"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority.  The Ruffians run. The bowman makes it off the edge, while
the remaining three fan out (one jumping the fence) in hopes of escape.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Desperate to kill more opponents, Maggot and Wolf charge separate opponents
this turn.  The combat results are split with each side winning one, but neither side manages to inflict any
wounds.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 12</h3>

<p><a href="Images/Img_2825.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thImg_2825.jpg" alt="Turn 12" title="Turn 12"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority.  Maggot and Wolf charge, while the unengaged Ruffian runs for
the edge.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil wins both combats, but again no wounds are inflicted.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 13</h3>

<p><a href="Images/Img_2826.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thImg_2826.jpg" alt="Turn 13" title="Turn 13"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority.  Another Ruffian makes it off board.  One more to go for an
Evil win!  The others double back and get as far along as they can.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Maggot and Wolf charge a single enemy, hoping for an apparently hard to get
kill.  (I say "apparently" because you sure can't tell from this replay that strikes kill on a 4+.)
The combat roll is a tie.  Maggot could
allow the roll-off, or automatically win by using his Might point.  He thinks ... and thinks ... should he save
the Might for a Heroic move if needed next turn? ... but finally decides to spend it.  The strike rolls come through
and another Ruffian falls.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The game is now riding on the fate of the last Ruffian.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 14</h3>

<p><a href="Images/Img_2827.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thImg_2827.jpg" alt="Turn 14" title="Turn 14"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, but since the roll was tied it was only by virtue of Evil
having Priority last turn.  Maggot and Wolf charge.  Good wins the Combat, and Maggot <i>again</i> fails to
wound.  But Wolf comes through and the game ends in a narrow victory for Good.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Post-game Thoughts</h3>

<p class="initialCap">A fun scenario, very manageable.  As with all the smaller scenarios, I think
luck plays a larger role than skill.  Still, I'd happily play this one again. It wents quickly enough that I got in
two playings in an evening despite all the extra time it takes for taking notes and pictures.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Though it's probably worth coming up with a house rule to prevent the Ruffians
from just waltzing off the board as in my first playthrough.</p>
