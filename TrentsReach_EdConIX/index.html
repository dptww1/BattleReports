<h1>Trent's Reach</h1>
    
<h1>The EdCon IX Grudge Match</h1>

<hr>
    
<p class="initialCap">This ACW naval miniatures scenario was played at EdCon IX in February, 2002.
The paint was barely dry on the shoreline and some of the ships, but it all
came together pretty well in the end.

<p class="initialCap">This is a "grudge match" because we played nearly the same scenario last year,
albeit some of the cast was different.  The scenario was a bit better defined this time around, too.
Like players, referees benefit from a bit of experience.

<p class="initialCap">Rules used: <a href="http://www.rapiermedia.net/acwnaval/sotw2/Default.html">Smoke on the Water</a>,
with 1/600 ships from <a href="http://www.thoroughbredmodels.com">Thoroughbred Models</a>.  Photos

<p class="initialCap">If you haven't heard of Trent's Reach, you're not alone.  It's not as
famous a battle as Hampton Roads (<em>Monitor</em> vs <em>Virginia/Merrimack</em>) or the
adventures of the <em>Arkansas</em>.  What happened was this: in early 1865 the Confederate James River squadron
sortied from Richmond in hopes of disrupting Grant's supply line and raising the siege of Petersburg.
The result was almost a non-battle, as the squadron had a comic propensity to run aground as they
came down the river.  One ship would run aground; another ship would come up to help and ground
itself in the process, etc. Real Keystone Kops material. The delays in getting back underway
forfeited the advantage of surprise, allowing the dilatory Union squadron commander to
come up and, in combination with shore batteries, chase the Confederates back up the river.

<p class="initialCap">So the scenario here is a bit of a what-if, in that the Union response
time is delayed slightly compared to historical performance, and the Confederates are assumed to
be led by a more aggressive commander with clear orders to get through the Union squadron.  To
win, the Confederates must exit ships from the east edge of the map.  Either side wins by
destroying the other, of course.

<p class="initialCap">I made some scenario setup sheets for the
<a href="unionsetup.html">Union</a>
and
<a href="confederatesetup.html">Confederate</a>
players which give a little more background on the specifics of this scenario.
I've also got some
<a href="refereenotes.html">refereeing and order of battle</a>
notes which might be useful.

<p class="initialCap">
That's me (standing) doing the referee thing ("Now where was that rule again?")
with the Confederate team, Tito Autrey, Chuck Frascati, and Jim Pyle, on the west edge of the
map. They commanded the following squadron:
    
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" border="0">
<tr><td><em>Virginia II</em>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>ironclad&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>grounded at start</td></tr>
<tr><td><em>Richmond</em>      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>ironclad&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>grounded at start</td></tr>
<tr><td><em>Fredericksburg</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>ironclad&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>enters turn 1</td></tr>
<tr><td><em>Drewry</em>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>paddlewheel gunboat&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>grounded at start</td></tr>
<tr><td><em>Hornet</em>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>torpedo boat&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>enters turn 1</td></tr>
<tr><td><em>Scorpion</em>      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>torpedo boat&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>enters turn 1</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="initialCap">There were several other Confederate ships present, but we limited players
to two ships each to speed play and lighten the workload on each player.

<p class="initialCap">The blue masking tape on the map (barely visible in front of me)
represents a line of Union obstructions: sunken ships, booms, shallows, etc.  Ships can run over
it, but risk grounding if they do.  Why doesn't it extend all the way across the river?  It did,
actually, but when the scenario begins <em>Fredericksburg</em> and the wooden vessels have
already sounded out the obstructions and removed some of the booms during the previous night.  (This is historical;
<em>Fredericksburg</em> went a couple of miles downriver in the night, only to come back when
the other ironclads failed to join her.  Which they did because they were, you guessed it, aground.)

<br style="clear: both">

<p>
<a href="Pics/Dscn4460.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/Tscn4460.jpg" width="320" height="240" alt="The Union"></a>
<p class="initialCap">On the Union side were Mike Rea, Matthew Beach, and Pete Giancola.  Pete's not shown
because he was taking the pictures!  The Union squadron includes the fearsome double-turreted monitor
<em>Onondaga</em> (in front of Mike), paddlewheel gunboats <em>Hunchback</em> (at the edge of the picture)
and <em>Massasoit</em>, and two torpedo boats.

<p class="initialCap">The Union side also has Battery Wilcox, with one light and one medium rifled gun,
which is on the land tile at Matthew's left elbow.

<p class="initialCap">All Union ships actually begin off map, so this picture was taken after
several turns had already passed.

<p class="initialCap">The game opens with a fair bit of dierolling, as the Confederates try to
get their stuck ships underway, and the Union players try to get their ships on the map.  Historically, the
Confederates had bad rolls and the Union had good rolls, so to speak.  But here,
<em>Virginia II</em> freed itself on the first turn, joining the rest of the Confederate squadron entering
the map. Turn 2 saw <em>Drewry</em> break free and the Confederate ships maneuver slowly around the obstructions
on the south half of the river.

<p>
<a href="Pics/Dscn4449.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/Tscn4449.jpg" width="320" height="240" alt="The Confederates" style="float: right"></a>

<p class="initialCap">Poor <em>Richmond</em> broke the streak of Confederate good luck.  She kept trying
to break free.  And trying.  And trying....

<p class="initialCap">Meanwhile, the Union wooden ships entered pretty sharply, but <em>Onondaga</em>,
the sole ironclad, stubbornly refused to show up until three or four turns in.  For a while, it
looked like <em>Hunchback</em> was going to face the entire Confederate fleet alone.  With no other
targets nearby, she took the brunt of the Confederate fire, and turned to Swiss cheese pretty quickly.

<p class="initialCap">You might wonder, given the situation, why the Confederate commanders look so glum,
in this picture, but as we resolved the move (turn 4 or 5) .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

<br style="clear: both">

<a href="Pics/Dscn4448.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/Tscn4448.jpg" width="320" height="240" alt="Virginia II is rammed"></a>
<p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it turned out that a Confederate torpedo boat had rammed the <em>Virginia II</em>.
Which is bad, because the torpedo boats are armed with a torpedo that explodes on contact.  Ooops!
The result was a sunk torpedo boat, and a moderate leak in the <em>Virginia II</em>.

<p class="initialCap">Somewhere around this time the Union scored a lucky hit on
<em>Drewry</em>, which killed its captain and pilot.  This hampered its manueverability a bit;
indeed, I thought that it would be <em>Drewry</em> rather than a torpedo boat that collided with a
friendly ship.

<p class="initialCap">Earlier I had been worried that the Confederates would rush to an easy
victory before the Union woke up.  Now I worried that the <em>Virginia II</em> would sink
before the action had really begun. Fortunately, the ironclad's crew stoppered the leak after a couple of
turns, before serious damage was done.

<br style="clear: both">

<p>
<a href="Pics/Dscn4471.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/Tscn4471.jpg" width="320" height="240" alt="CSA moves around the obstructions" style="float: right"></a>

<p class="initialCap">The Confederate ships continued to manuever around the shallows in line ahead formation.
I'd heard of admirals crossing the 'T' before, but here the <em>Hunchback</em> had crossed an 'S'!
Unfortunate <em>Richmond</em> was still aground.  <em>Onondaga</em> and <em>Massasoit</em> rushed in
to take some pressure off <em>Hunchback</em>.

<p class="initialCap">Both sides now had torpedo boats near the enemy, and I was looking forward to
exercising the collision and torpedo detonation rules again.  But the two boats between the fleets were
shot to splinters, and the remaining Union boat rammed his squadron mate <em>Hunchback</em> rather than
the enemy.  (The picture actually shows the position just before the collision, but the ships couldn't
turn quickly enough to avoid brushing against each other on the following turn.)  The boat survived
the collision, but her torpedo didn't, so all she could do in the future was absorb enemy shells.
A few turns later she was sunk.

<p><em class="initialCap">Hunchback</em> fought to the last, but drew so much fire that she
was sunk in one turn.  Unsurprisingly, wooden ships really have a hard time surviving against ironclads.

<br style="clear: both">

<p>
<a href="Pics/Dscn4475.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/Tscn4475.jpg" width="320" height="240" alt="Resolving a move"></a>
<p class="initialCap">Passing the obstructions, the Confederates spread out a bit, with <em>Virginia II</em>
heading for the south side of the river, <em>Drewry</em> going down the middle, and <em>Fredericksburg</em> heading
for the north bank.  Unfortunately, the latter misjudged its course and ran aground on the edge of the
obstructions.  <em>Richmond</em> finally got underway, though she doesn't show up in this picture.

<p class="initialCap">On the Union side, <em>Onondaga</em> continued straight ahead.  Around this time the Confederates
nailed her with two lucky hits.  One jammed a gun port on the forward turret, taking away 25% of the ship's
firepower; the other hit the rudder.  We had to roll to see which way the rudder jammed, and this
was a very tense roll indeed.  There was roughly a 60% chance that the ship wouldn't be able to turn to port,
which would have been disastrous given the ship's position.  But the dice gods wore blue, and 
<em>Onondaga</em> only lost the ability to turn to starboard.

<p class="initialCap">So <em>Onondaga</em> engaged <em>Richmond</em> and <em>Fredericksburg</em>, while the two wooden
vessels exchanged fire, and <em>Virginia II</em> and the shore battery took potshots from the side.

<p class="initialCap">The new piece of blue masking tape marks the remains of <em>Hunchback</em>.

<br style="clear: both">

<p>
<a href="Pics/Dscn4482.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/Tscn4482.jpg" width="320" height="240" alt="Is the fire out yet?" style="float: right"></a>
<p class="initialCap">Several fires broke out on <em>Massasoit</em>.  The crew bravely fought on for a few more
turns, but the fire got out of control and forced the crew to abandon ship.  <em>Virginia II</em>
sped off the map more or less unharmed (thick armor is nice!), while <em>Drewry</em> lost a paddlewheel,
a almost all her hull, and yet another captain.  The accumulated damage immobilized her and she gradually
drifted to a halt.

<p class="initialCap">Battery Wilcox would no doubt have finished off <em>Drewry</em>, but events near the obstructions
focused our attention there.

<br style="clear: both">

<p>
<a href="Pics/Dscn4483.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/Tscn4483.jpg" width="320" height="240" alt="Onondaga and her prey"></a>
<p class="initialCap"><em>Fredericksburg</em> had been getting the worse of her exchange with
<em>Onondaga</em> for several turns when a lucky shot from Battery Wilcox, of all places, scored a critical hit and
<em>Fredericksburg</em>'s boilers burst, forcing the abandonment of the ship.

<p class="initialCap">With <em>Richmond</em> finally underway, it seemed like a good bet
that she'd actually get off the map, but next turn she pulled up near the battle and
<em>Onondaga</em> burst her boiler, too. The odds of two burst boilers so close in time are about 1 in 100,000, but
the unpredictability is why we game, right?

<p class="initialCap">Since <em>Onondaga</em> was the only mobile ship on the map, we called it a day.

<br style="clear: both">

<a href="Pics/Dscn4488.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/Tscn4488.jpg" width="320" height="240" alt="The End" style="float: right"></a>
<p class="initialCap">Who won?  I ruled it a Union marginal victory.  The only effect of the torpedo boats
was to inflict a hit on their own side, so they were a wash.  The Confederates sunk two Union
paddlewheelers, while losing one gunboat and two ironclads themselves: advantage Union.  Finally,
<em>Virginia II</em> had been reduced to Medium speed and had lost over 25% of her hull points,
while <em>Onondaga</em> was still Fast and had under 25% damage.  So even though <em>Virginia II</em>
was farther down the river, <em>Onondaga</em> could catch up fairly quicky and had a reasonable
chance of winning.

<p class="initialCap">It seems to me that this is a pretty common result, so maybe I should have
ruled it an historical victory but a player draw.  See the
referee notes
for some additional thoughts.
