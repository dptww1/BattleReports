<h1>Trent's Reach: Confederate Setup</h1>

<h3>Dawn, January 25, 1865</h3>

<p class="initialCap">Things are bleak for the Confederacy.  The Union Army under Grant
has crossed the James River and has Petersburg, the key to the defense
of Richmond, under siege.  Secretary of the Navy Stephen Mallory has
ordered the powerful Confederate fleet based in Richmond to cut
Grant's communications by blockading the James River at City Point.
If successful, Grant could be forced back and the Confederacy will
gain valuable time.

<p class="initialCap">Conditions for the operation have been propitious.  Winter freshets
have flooded the river, which eases navigation, and much of the
Federal squadron has been called away for the assault on Fort Fisher.
But the Confederate fleet has not had a good night.  The trip
downstream to the Federal obstructions at Trent's Reach (about 12
miles from City Point) has been plagued by ships running aground.  The
ships have been refloated, but valuable time has been lost.

<p class="initialCap">Last night, the ships finally reached the line of
obstructions. <em>C.S.S. Fredericksburg</em>, with the shallowest draft,
successfully crossed the obstructions and proceeded several miles up
the river.  The other ships stopped to inspect the obstructions and
sound out the depth of the river.  When <em>Fredericksburg</em> had no
reinforcement after several hours, she returned to Trent's Reach only
to find the squadron flagship, <em>C.S.S. Virginia II</em>, aground and stuck
fast.  Attempting to come to her aid, several other ships in the
squadron also ran aground.

<p class="initialCap">Commander John K. Mitchell, commander of the expedition, ordered the
remainder of the squadron to the protective cover of Battery Dantzler
(just off map to the west) while the stuck ships wait for the rising
tide to help lift them off the sand bar.

<p class="initialCap">It is now dawn, and the squadron must decide on its course of action
for the day.  Can the ships make it to City Point after all?

<h3>Setup</h3>

<p class="initialCap">Deploy ironclads <em>Virginia II</em>, <em>Richmond</em>, and
sidewheel steamer <em>Drewry</em> on the Confederate side of the
obstructions.  <em>Virginia II</em> is to the north; <em>Richmond</em> to the south,
with <em>Drewry</em> on its port beam.

<p class="initialCap">Off map to the west are ironclad <em>Fredericksburg</em>, sidewheel
steamers <em>Beaufort</em>, <em>Torpedo</em>, and <em>Hampton</em>,
and torpedo boats <em>Hornet</em> and <em>Wasp</em>.  As part of
setup, the Confederates must decide what formation, order, and turn
the above will enter play (write it down and give it to the ref,
please).

<h3>Victory</h3>

<p class="initialCap">Squadron exits east edge of map in good condition, or sink Union squadron.

<p class="initialCap">Historically, the Union shore batteries blew up one gunboat and
knocked another out of control.  <em>Virginia II</em> escaped back up river
just as the <em>Onondaga</em> arrived and punctured the Confederates heaviest
casemate armor.
 
<h3>Options</h3>

<p class="initialCap"><strong>Intelligence (2)</strong>: Friendly locals inform you of
the ships and artillery available to the Union.  This is not
necessarily perfect intelligence - the referee will confer with the
Union player and tell you what you've learned.

<p class="initialCap"><strong>Battery Dantzler (1)</strong>: Confederates can fire on the
map from Battery Dantzler, which has 1 x HR which can fire at Extreme
Range anywhere on the Confederate side of the obstructions.  Trace
Line of Sight from the middle of the west edge of the land block on
the southwestern corner.

<p class="initialCap"><strong>Fireships (2/each)</strong>: Sidewheel steamers can be
converted to fireships, which will drift down the river at Slow speed.
Collision with wooden ships of either side could be dangerous.
Collision with ironclads will have little effect - probably.

<p class="initialCap"><strong>Bombships (4/each)</strong>: Sidewheel steamers can be
loaded up with gunpowder and ignited as bombs.  Because the crew is
skeletal, the only gunfire allowed is to fire the bow gun once per
game.  Incoming gunfire could be quite lethal. Move at Slow speed and
mark "Ignite" in the log on the turn that you want to set the fuses.
The referee will resolve the move/explosions starting on the next
turn.

<p class="initialCap"><strong>Torpedo Outriggers (2/each)</strong>: Ironclads can be
equipped with anti-torpedo rigging (note in log) which allows the
vessel to use the "Mine Catcher" modifier (-4) on the Torpedo Damage
table.  Any collisions with ships (enemy or friendly) other than
torpedo boats will strip the rigging on the side on which the
collision occurred.

<p class="initialCap"><strong>Additional Torpedos (2/each)</strong>: <em>Virginia II</em> and
<em>Fredericksburg</em> can be equipped with Medium spar torpedoes.  (<em>Richmond</em>
comes with one by default.)

<p class="initialCap"><strong>Local Pilot (1)</strong>: A local ferry pilot is located
who will help navigate the river.  Assign him to a ship.  That vessel
gets to use the "Local Pilot" modifier on the Running Aground table.

<p class="initialCap"><strong>Players' choice(?)</strong>: can you think of something
that I didn't?  The referee is open to negotiations.

<p class="initialCap">The historical options: Battery Dantzler and Torpedo Outriggers for all ironclads, total 7 points.
