<h1>Trent's Reach: Referee Notes</h1>

<h3>The Map</h3>

<p class="initialCap">I designed the map to fit comfortably on a ping-pong table, 9' x 5'.
I wanted to make modular terrain for greater flexibility, so I arbitrarily
chose a tile size of 1' x 1' and overlaid a grid of the proper scale
over the map in Coski's book (see <a href="#sources">Sources</a>, below).
This gave a map schematic looking like this:

<p class="initialCap"><img src="MapSchematic.png" width="324" height="180" alt="Table layout">

<p class="initialCap">This is actually a bit small, as the Confederate ships grounded
slightly offmap to the west.  It might have been better to shift the
grid a column or two left, which would allow the Confederates to be in
their proper places.  Plus it would be more visually interesting, as
the river is only 1.5 squares wide two columns to the west of what's
depicted here.  Of course, if your table is larger than a ping-pong
table, then off you go.

<p class="initialCap">The light blue line is the Union obstructions.  Historically,
<em>Fredericksburg</em> had cut away some of the booms on the northern
end, which is why I only put the line halfway out for my game.
<br>

<p class="initialCap">I didn't worry about shallows too much, but given the historical
Confederate problems with running aground, maybe some shoals would be
appropriate.  It should probably be noted that I ignored <em>Smoke on
the Water</em>'s 3-strikes-and-you're-out grounding rule, both for
play balance reasons and because historically there was a rising tide
at dawn an that is what eventually freed the stuck ships.

<h3>Balance</h3>

<p class="initialCap">I've tried this scenario three times now and while the steps along the way
have differed entertainingly, the end result always seems to be the same: wooden
ships are sunk, <em>Onondaga</em> manhandles the Confederate ironclads,
while <em>Virginia II</em> zips off the map with some minor damage.  It seems to me
like the situation is inherently tilted slightly towards to Union.

<p class="initialCap">I used the player options (see the Player Notes) to allow the players to perform
a bit of self-balancing. I told the players that they could pick as many options
as they wanted, but then the victory evaluation would be weighted on the ratio of
options taken vs the historical level.  In practice, neither side wanted to load
up with options.  I'm not sure whether it was an unwillingness to complicate things
(many were first-time players) or an intentional strategy to increase chances of victory.
At any rate, were I to do it again I might just say both sides could
pick 8 (or whatever) points.

<br>
<h3>Recreating History</h3>

<p class="initialCap">I've read enough history that two things in our battle rather bothered me.
Not enough to ruin the fun, mind you, but they did make me do some further
research.

<p class="initialCap">First, the speed of <em>Virginia II</em> seems most suspicious.  If
you research her stats, "speed: 10 knots" keeps cropping up.  Looking
at the other Confederate ironclads, most were closer to 6 knots than
to 10. The <em>Atlanta</em> had good engines taken from the blockade
runner <em>Fingal</em> and she didn't make ten knots. Additionally,
<em>Virginia II</em> had thicker armor (and so heavier, and so slower)
than most other Confederate ironclads. So what gives?

<p class="initialCap">I believe the source for "10 knots" is an intelligence report
from a Confederate deserter in the
<a href="http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/moa/moa_browse.html">Official Records of the Navy in the War of the Rebellion</a>,
specifically <a href='http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/pageviewer?frames=1&amp;coll=moa&amp;view=50&amp;root=%2Fmoa%2Fofre%2Fofre0011%2F&amp;tif=00411.TIF&amp;cite=http%3A%2F%2Fcdl.library.cornell.edu%2Fcgi-bin%2Fmoa%2Fmoa-cgi%3Fnotisid%3DANU4547-0011'>Vol XI p.381</a>.
But that informant didn't actually serve on <em>Virginia II</em>, and other interrogations (p. 382)
say that <em>Richmond</em> was the same speed as <em>Virginia II</em> -- but no one claims that
tubby <em>Richmond</em> was a 10 knot ship.

<p class="initialCap">So overall I'm rather inclined to discount this evidence and feel <em>Virginia II</em>
should be downgraded to 6-9 knots. Using <em>Smoke on the Water</em> rules, she goes from "Fast" to "Medium".

<p class="initialCap">The second thing that bothered me was the relative ineffectiveness of
<em>Onondaga</em>'s 15" smoothbore guns (SHSB in <em>Smoke on the Water</em> terms).
Historically, one hit with these knocked in <em>Virginia II</em>'s end armor (8" backed by wood,
SH in <em>Smoke on the Water</em>) but in the game the smoothbores have too little
range and penetrating power to recreate history there.  It seems backwards to
me when the Confederates are fearing the 11" rifles rather than the 15" smoothbores
in the monitors.

<p class="initialCap">Coski, John. <em>Capital Navy</em>. Savas Publishing Company,
1996. Well-written account of the James River Squadron.  Maps are few
but excellent. Includes ironclad plans by David Meagher.  Highly
recommended.

<p class="initialCap">Konstam, Angus. <em>Confederate Ironclad</em>. Osprey, 2001.
The usual Osprey treatment. Looks nice, but take everything with a grain
of salt. Everything.  It's cheap for a reason.

<p class="initialCap">Silverstone, Paul. <em>Civil War Navies</em>. Naval Institute Press, 2001.
Your standard encyclopedia-of-ships tome. Useful for tracking down the wooden
vessels. Stats for the Confederate ironclads vary with what I've seen published elsewhere.
Has picture of <em>Spuyten Duyvil</em>. Useful.

<p class="initialCap">Still, William Jr. <em>Iron Afloat</em>. University of South Carolina Press, 1985.
The standard guide to the Confederate ironclads (though no mention of the European
ironclads like <em>Stonewall</em>. Surprisingly, devotes a few pages (out of only 250)
to Trent's Reach.  Good book, but out of print.

<p class="initialCap">The <a href="http://www.ameritech.net/users/maxdemon/ironclad.htm">Ironclads and Blockade Runners</a>
web site is excellent, and you can't beat the price.
