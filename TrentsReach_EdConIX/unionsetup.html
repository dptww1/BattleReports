<h1>Trent's Reach: Union Setup</h1>

<h3>Dawn, January 25, 1865</h3>

<p class="initialCap">Grant's siege of Petersburg marks a new low in the war for the
Confederates.  Still, they are resisting stubbornly and the war is by
no means over.  It is crucial for the Union navy to guard Grant's
communications with his depots at City Point.  The biggest threat to
them is the squadron of three powerful ironclads based near Richmond.
Several times they have sortied from the safety of Drewry's Bluff to
shell Union artillery positions along the north bank of the James
River. But reports over the last several days have placed the
Confederates closer and closer to Trent's Reach, a bottleneck on the
river some ten miles from City Point.  Could the ironclads be
attempting to break out and destroy Grant's supply line?

<p class="initialCap">As dawn breaks, the Union artillery positions overlooking Trent's
Reach see an almost comical site: several Confederate ships appear to
have grounded near the Federal obstructions in the river.

<p class="initialCap">It's now up to the batteries and the local naval squadron to
overwhelm the Confederates and remove the threat posed by their
ironclads.

<p class="initialCap">Unfortunately, the Union squadron has been weakened by the
transferal of many ships for the attack on Fort Fisher. Also,
Commander William Parker (in command of the Union flotilla) is not
known as an aggressive commander.

<p class="initialCap">Still, Admiral Porter has every confidence that the ships remaining
to you will be sufficient to the task at hand.

<h3>Setup</h3>

<p class="initialCap">No ships are deployed on map.

<p class="initialCap">Ironclad <em>Onondaga</em> rolls a d10 for entry at the beginning
of each turn (including turn 1), and enters the east map edge on a
roll of 8, 9, or 10.  (You must announce that you're rolling for ship
entry and make the roll publicly, but you don't have to reveal what
numbers you're trying for until you roll them.)

<p class="initialCap">Sidewheel steamers <em>Massasoit</em> and <em>Hunchback</em> roll a
d10 for entry as above, but enter on a 6-10.

<p class="initialCap">Only one ship can enter per turn. If multiple ships succeed on the
same turn, decide mutually who will enter this turn, and the other
automatically enters next turn (and so on if three or more ships are
simultaneously successful.) Ships enter at Medium speed.

<h3>Victory</h3>

<p>
Sink Confederate ships.<br>
Prevent Confederates from exiting east edge of map.<br>
Historically, the Union shore batteries blew up one gunboat and
knocked another out of control.  <em>Virginia II</em> escaped back up
river just as the <em>Onondaga</em> arrived and punctured the
Confederate's heaviest casemate armor.

<h3>Options</h3>

<p class="initialCap"><strong>Intelligence (1)</strong>: Friendly locals inform you of the ships and
artillery available to the Confederates.  This is not necessarily
perfect intelligence - the referee will confer with the Confederate
player and tell you what you've learned.

<p class="initialCap"><strong>Saugus and Canonicus (3)</strong>: Substitute these two
monitors for <em>Onondaga</em>. Entry dr range is as per
<em>Onondaga</em>.

<p class="initialCap"><strong>Torpedo Boats (2 each)</strong>: Add <em>Torpedo Boat
#1</em> and/or <em>Torpedo Boat #2</em> to your OOB.  The former
enters with <em>Massasoit</em>, the latter with <em>Hunchback</em>.
(This doesn't violate the "1-ship-enters-per-turn" rule because these
are boats, not ships. <tt>:^)</tt>)

<p class="initialCap"><strong>Battery Wilcox (3)</strong>: Union can fire on the map from Battery Wilcox, which has one MR and one LR (40 FDPs). Measure range and LOS from southwest corner of southeast map tile.

<p class="initialCap"><strong>Battery Parsons (3)</strong>: Union can fire on the map from Battery Parsons, which has one MR and one LR (40 FDPs). Measure range and LOS from southeast corner of map.

<p class="initialCap"><strong>Battery Spofford (2)</strong>: Union can fire on the map from Battery Spofford, which has one MR and one LR (40 FDPs). Measure range and LOS from northeast corner of southeast map tile, and add 50 cm to all range measurements.

<p class="initialCap"><strong>Psychological Warfare (2)</strong>: Take four spare coins and put them anywhere on the eastern half of the waterway.  They don't mean anything, but they'll sure make the Confederates wonder….

<p class="initialCap"><strong>Sunken Hulk (2 + Psychological Warfare cost)</strong>: One of the spare coins marks the location of a sunken hulk.  Write down the exact location, within 10cm of the marker in any direction and give it to the referee.  The water in that spot counts as a "Wreck in Shallow Water" for purposes of the Grounding Table.  Careful - it affects both sides!

<p class="initialCap"><strong>Torpedo Warfare (2 each + Psychological Warfare cost)</strong>: A Fixed Contact Medium Torpedo (max 4, one per coin) is floating in the vicinity of a coin marker (max one torpedo per coin).  Write down the exact location, within 10cm of the marker in any direction and give it to the referee.  (A coin cannot have a torpedo and a sunken wreck.)

<p class="initialCap"><strong>Torpedo Outriggers (2/each)</strong>: Ironclads can be equipped with anti-torpedo rigging (note in log) which allows the vessel to use the "Mine Catcher" modifier (-4) on the Torpedo Damage table.  Any collisions with ships (enemy or friendly) other than torpedo boats will strip the rigging on the side on which the collision occurred.

<p class="initialCap"><strong>Players' choice(?)</strong>: can you think of something that I didn't?  The referee is open to negotiations.

<p class="initialCap">The historical options: Batteries Wilcox, Parsons, and Spofford, total 8 points.
