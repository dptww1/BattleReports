<h1>Trent's Reach</h1>
    
<h1>The EdCon X Playthrough</h1>

<hr>
    
<p class="initialCap">This ACW naval miniatures scenario was played at EdCon X in February, 2003.
We did the same scenario <a href="../TrentsReach_EdConIX/">last year</a>, and a stripped-down version
the year before that, too.  It's time for a change next year, but there were still enough surprises
this time to keep it interesting for the referee.  It seemed like the players had fun, too.

<p class="initialCap">Of course the big advantage to repeating a scenario is how much easier it
was for me to prepare.  Last year I spent the week before the game frantically assembling terrain,
painting up models, preparing log sheets, writing up the scenario, etc.  This year I just made a few
more printouts and reread the rules.  Much more relaxing!

<p class="initialCap">Rules used: <a href="http://www.canis-publ.demon.co.uk/sotw2/Default.html">Smoke on the Water</a>,

that we get a shot of you next year!

<p class="initialCap">
At the west side of the map are the Confederate commanders, Matthew Beach (front)
and Andy House (back), with me apparently mesmerized by the <em>Virginia II</em>.  Pete Giancola
joined Andy and Matthew in command, but he's hidden behind the camera.  The only ships starting
on the map are, from left to right, <em>Drewrey</em>, <em>Richmond</em>, and <em>Virginia II</em>, which
begin grounded and must roll to break free.  The remainder of the Confederate squadron begins offmap
and may enter on the first turn.
    
<p class="initialCap">The Confederates used 8 points of
<a href="../TrentsReach_EdConIX/confederatesetup.html">scenario options</a>: torpedo outriggers
on the ironclads, a local pilot on the <em>Virginia II</em>, and Battery Dantzler.

<br style="clear: right">

<p class="initialCap">
<a href="Pics/Dscn6674.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/SDSCN6674.JPG" width="320" height="240" style="float: left" alt="Pic"></a>
To the east are the Union commanders: Tito Autrey, Romana Autrey, and Rick Barber.  This
picture's taken a few turns in, so the map is much busier than in the last picture.  I don't like to
jump ahead, but this is the best cast shot of the Federals that I have.

<p class="initialCap">The Union squadron consists of just one ironclad, <em>Onondaga</em>, aided
by two paddlewheelers, <em>Hunchback</em> and <em>Massasoit</em>.  They begin offmap and can only enter by
dieroll.

<p class="initialCap">The Union commanders chose 7 points of
<a href="../TrentsReach_EdConIX/unionsetup.html">scenario options</a>:
Battery Wilcox,
one Torpedo Boat, and Psychological Warfare.  The latter is represented by the four pennies that can
barely be seen in the picture, deployed near the gap in the obstructions (the blue masking tape).
They have no effect on play -- their sole purpose is to make the Confederates worry a bit.

<p class="initialCap">You can just see Battery Wilcox underneath Rick's hand, with the
hex tile and artillery pieces courtesy of his <strong>Battle Cry</strong> set.

<br style="clear: left">

<p><a href="Pics/Dscn6666.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/SDSCN6666.JPG" width="320" height="240" style="float: right" alt="Pic"></a>

<p class="initialCap">The game opens with a fair bit of dierolling, as the Confederates try to
get their stuck ships underway, and the Union players try to get their ships on the map.  In a near
carbon copy of last year, the <em>Drewrey</em> and <em>Virginia II</em> freed themselves early, while
the <em>Richmond</em> sat there....and sat there, not freeing itself 'til turn 5.  The rest of the
Confederate ships entered on turn 1.

<p class="initialCap">This picture was taken from behind them at the end of turn 1.  From left
to right: <em>Fredericksburg</em>, <em>Wasp</em>, <em>Hornet</em>, <em>Virginia II</em>,
<em>Torpedo</em>, <em>Hampton</em>, <em>Drewrey</em>, <em>Richmond</em>.  Yes, it's mildly
confusing that <em>Torpedo</em> is not in fact a torpedo boat. 

<p class="initialCap">Were I to run this scenario again, I would probably make the other Confederate
ships enter by dieroll rather than allowing them all to enter on turn 1.  Perhaps they'd require a
6-10 to enter on a d10?  It would certainly make things a bit less predictable, which is always good,
but it would also promote a more realistic distance between the ships.

<br style="clear: right">

<p><a href="Pics/Dscn6670.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/SDSCN6670.JPG" width="320" height="240" style="float: left" alt="Pic"></a>

<p class="initialCap">Last year the Union ships had trouble getting on board, but there was no
such problem this time, as despite the need for dierolls they got on map as quickly as possible.
Here you can see the beginning of turn 2, with <em>Hunchback</em> entering in the middle of the
river with <em>Onondaga</em> to the north.

<p class="initialCap">The Confederates opened fire at extreme range, and were rewarded for their
efforts by an explosion of the <em>Fredericksburg</em>'s forward heavy rifle.  Not an auspicious start
for the Confederates.

<br style="clear: left">

<p><a href="Pics/Dscn6673.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/SDSCN6673.JPG" width="320" height="240" style="float: right" alt="Pic"></a>

<p class="initialCap">The following turn a torpedo boat and the <em>Massasoit</em> entered the
map near the southern bank, while the Confederates advanced all across the river.  <em>Hornet</em>
and <em>Hampton</em> swung towards the north bank, <em>Drewrey</em> and <em>Wasp</em> decided to risk
crossing the obstructions in the south, and the ironclads came up as quickly as possible behind
<em>Torpedo</em> in the center.

<p class="initialCap">Confederate gunfire homed in on the <em>Hunchback</em> and caused a fire.
This year was the first time we played using shell ammo as well as solid shot.  As a result, the
wooden ships <em>really</em> took a beating.  The Fire Check caused by a successful
shell detonation started quite a few fires, perhaps more than might be historically warranted.
I'd be tempted in the future to tone down the fires a bit.

<br style="clear: right">

<p><a href="Pics/Dscn6676.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/SDSCN6676.JPG" width="320" height="240" style="float: left" alt="Pic"></a>

<p class="initialCap">Here's <em>Hunchback</em> in it's misery.  Not much more to add here.  I just
think it's a cool picture.

<br style="clear: left">

<p><a href="Pics/Dscn6677.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/SDSCN6677.JPG" width="320" height="240" style="float: right" alt="Pic"></a>

<p class="initialCap">Here's the same position viewed from the east.  Note Battery Wilcox (lower left),
stranded <em>Richmond</em> at the far end of the table, and Andy's apparent interest in my shoes.  (We were
looking at some spare ironclad models on the ground in the corner, and I was too lazy to point with my fingers.)

<br style="clear: right">

<p><a href="Pics/Dscn6689.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/SDSCN6689.JPG" width="320" height="240" style="float: left" alt="Pic"></a>

<p class="initialCap">Things really started to get interesting the following turn, as Andy came within
a few millimeters of ramming the <em>Onondaga</em> with a torpedo boat.  We had to resolve the movement
phase one centimeter at a time to figure out whether the ships collided or not. Somewhat anticlimatically,
though to Tito's relief, the slow-mo replay showed that they didn't.

<p class="initialCap">In the center, <em>Drewrey</em> got stuck trying to cross the obstacle
line.

<p class="initialCap">After the picture was taken, we noticed that the two torpedo boats just
east of obstacles must have collided during movement.  C.S.S. <em>Wasp</em> survived the subsequent
collision resolution.  U.S.S.  <em>Torpedo Boat #1</em> was not so lucky and fell apart.

<br style="clear: left">

<p><a href="Pics/Dscn6693.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/SDSCN6693.JPG" width="320" height="240" style="float: right" alt="Pic"></a>

<p class="initialCap">Completing movement didn't end the excitement, though.  The wooden ships took their
usual beating, but <em>Hunchback</em>'s foreward gun exacted a heavy toll on the Confederates, as her single
shot hit <em>Fredericksburg</em>.  The hit location roll resulted in a critical hit, which turned out to be a
Special critical hit, which resulted in a "Magazine Explodes" result, which <em>Fredericksburg</em>'s heavy
hull armor failed to deflect.  Result: the ironclad Blowed Up Real Good.  I compute that as a 1 in 8,000 odds.
Nice dicing, Romana.  (Rick pointed out that the earlier exploding gun on board <em>Fredericksburg</em> must
have caused more damage to the ship than we thought.)  Nearby <em>Virginia II</em> is close enough to the
explosion to get a Fire Test marker.

<p class="initialCap">In return, <em>Hunchback</em> lost a paddlewheel and a lot of hull points.
<em>Hampton</em> (in the middle background) bravely masks <em>Onondaga</em>, but as a result is also the lucky
recipient of a Fire Test Marker and a lot of damage.

<br style="clear: right">

<p><a href="Pics/Dscn6695.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/SDSCN6695.JPG" width="320" height="240" style="float: left" alt="Pic"></a>

<p class="initialCap">This picture shows the situation after all fire was complete.  The Confederates
have lost one ironclad entirely, have potential fires aboard two of their gunboats and a second ironclad,
and have grounded a third gunboat and third ironclad.  In return the Union has an essentially
out-of-commission <em>Hunchback</em> and a lost torpedo boat.  Things are looking pretty grim for
the Confederate squadon, no?

<br style="clear: left">

<p><a href="Pics/Dscn6705.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/SDSCN6705.JPG" width="320" height="240" style="float: right" alt="Pic"></a>

<p class="initialCap">But what a difference a turn makes!  The gunboats managed to extinguish
their fires and the grounded ships finally came unstuck.  In further good news for the Confederates,
<em>Onondaga</em> did not steer sufficiently clear of the out of control <em>Hunchback</em>, and so
collided with it.

<p class="initialCap">At the other bank of the river <em>Massasoit</em> rammed the <em>Wasp</em>, turning
it into matchsticks, but then grounded itself.  This was probably not the Union players' favorite turn.

<p class="initialCap">Note that <em>Torpedo</em> has turned away -- presumably from the threat of
Battery Wilcox -- and is actually heading northwest.  Likewise <em>Hornet</em>, the sole torpedo boat
on the map, is circling back towards <em>Onondaga</em>.

<br style="clear: right">

<p><a href="Pics/Dscn6712.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/SDSCN6712.JPG" width="320" height="240" style="float: left" alt="Pic"></a>

<p class="initialCap">The following turn was no kinder to the Union, as <em>Massasoit</em>
remained stuck and <em>Hornet</em> landed a beautifully placed torpedo hit on the <em>Onondaga</em>.
Fortune finally took pity on the Union as the torpedo turned out to be a dud so the Union vessel
escaped with minimal damage.  Still, the collisions had prevented <em>Onondaga</em> from firing
for two crucial turns, as the <em>Virginia II</em> slipped by <em>en route</em> to the map edge.

<p class="initialCap">Which the Confederate gunboats were racing for, too.  Over
the next few turns <em>Drewrey</em> and <em>Torpedo</em> escaped more or less unscathed.  Battered
<em>Hampton</em> was racing against time, or more properly the shells from Battery Wilcox,
and just barely managed to get off before being sunk.

<br style="clear: left">

<p><a href="Pics/Dscn6713.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/SDSCN6713.JPG" width="320" height="240" style="float: right" alt="Pic"></a>

<p class="initialCap">And yet another aggravating turn for the Union followed.  <em>Massasoit</em> finally
broke free, but <em>Onondaga</em> ran aground on the edge of the obstructions -- <em>another</em> turn
of not firing!  Tubby <em>Richmond</em> finally made it into the battle.

<p class="initialCap">Also now able to participate was the Confederates' Battery Dantzler, off map
to the west.  For game purposes it's a single heavy rifle shot at extreme range anywhere on the
western side of obstructions.  It fired away at <em>Onondaga</em> enthusiastically, but without effect over
the next few turns.

<br style="clear: right">

<p><a href="Pics/Dscn6716.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/SDSCN6716.JPG" width="320" height="240" style="float: left" alt="Pic"></a>

<p class="initialCap">And now the fourth consecutive turn of pain for the Union, as
<em>Onondaga</em> remains stuck.  <em>Richmond</em> hits her with both a ram and a spar
torpedo!  The collision causes some hull damage and a bit of minor flooding.  The torpedo resolution
dieroll is too tense for Pete -- if they succeed, it's pretty much game over -- so he makes Andy
roll the die.  And .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it's a dud.  That's twice within two turns now that the
Confederates have used good tactics and yet the die has failed them.  <em>C'est la guerre</em>.

<p class="initialCap">Farther off, brave <em>Massasoit</em> has pulled alongside <em>Virginia II</em>.
The ironclad has her stack knocked away, but at such short range the wooden ship is shredded.  With no
hull points remaining, the crew abandons ship.

<br style="clear: left">

<p><a href="Pics/Dscn6720.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/SDSCN6720.JPG" width="320" height="240" style="float: right" alt="Pic"></a>

<p class="initialCap">After ramming, <em>Richmond</em> needed to back up.  Interestingly, <em>Onondaga</em>
decided to escape the obstacles by backing up also.  Bumper cars, anyone?  With <em>Onondaga</em> now able
to fire, <em>Richmond</em> took fearsome damage without inflicting many casualties in return.

<p class="initialCap">Off in the distance, <em>Virginia II</em> is slowly but surely heading for the map
edge.  I say "slowly" literally, as she had her stack shot off, and since I cut her maximum speed back to
Medium she was now only capable of moving at "Slow" speed.  Battery Wilcox launched a furious bombardment, but
it's hard to do much to heavy armor with only medium and light guns.

<br style="clear: right">

<p><a href="Pics/Dscn6722.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/SDSCN6722.JPG" width="320" height="240" style="float: left" alt="Pic"></a>

<p class="initialCap">Once <em>Virginia II</em> left the map, the unequal battle between <em>Onondaga</em>
and <em>Richmond</em> ended in the inevitable (a sieve-like Confederate vessel) and that was the end of
the game.

<p class="initialCap">I ruled the game a Confederate marginal victory.  The rebs managed
to get four ships off the map, two of which were still in fighting trim.  That they did this
after losing one ironclad from the outset was even more impressive.

<p class="initialCap">Unfortunately for the South, <em>Onondaga</em> was still in good shape
despite her troubles during the game, hence the low magnitude of the victory.  The ships running
down to City Point to bombard Grant's supply line aren't going to last long once <em>Onondaga</em>
catches up.

<p class="initialCap">Both sides played well, with the torpedo boats not destroying themselves
on their own ships as they did last year.  I would still like to see a spar torpedo actually
damage a ship sometime, though!  The <b>Smoke on the Water</b> rules make ramming difficult,
probably more difficult than it historically was, due to the preplotting of moves.
