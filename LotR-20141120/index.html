<h1>Beating the Bounds</h1>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<p class="initialCap">Here's the second <i>Scouring of the Shire</i> scenario. Ten Ruffians
try to cross a long, narrow playing field the hard way. In their path are 5 hobbits, two of
which are archers, and a number of traps.  If the Ruffians exit six or more men, they win;
four or five men is a draw, and three or fewer is a win for the Hobbits.</p>

<p class="initialCap">With no leaders, this is a pretty straightforward scenario.  No
decisions about when to use Might points here!</p>

<p class="initialCap">On the face of it this doesn't seem like it's going to be very balanced.
Maybe it will play better than it looks?</p>

<h3>Setup</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_0178.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/IMG_0178.JPG" alt="Setup - Evil" title="Setup - Evil"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_0179.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/IMG_0179.JPG" alt="Setup - Good" title="Setup - Good"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">The Ruffians set up with archers on each flank and reasonably spread out
to maximize mobility getting through the woods.  I also roleplayed it a little bit and though
we-the-viewers can see the potential trap locations -- they are the big red, white, and blue
poker chips on the map -- the Ruffians themselves wouldn't know about them, so they don't
worry about minimizing their exposure to the traps.  Besides, half the traps are dummies.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The hobbits also set up centrally, with archers on the flank.  Let's
see what the Ruffians do.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 1</h3>

<p><a href="Images/IMG_0182.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/IMG_0182.JPG" alt="Turn 1" title="Turn 1"></a></p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, automatic</p>

<p class="initialCap">Both sides advance.  The Ruffians need to exit, and the Hobbits don't want to
begin the melee too close to their own baseline, where a bad priority roll might allow the Ruffians
to escape entirely.  The Ruffians in the foreground trigger the first trap, but it turns out to
be a decoy.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 2</h3>

<p><a href="Images/IMG_0186.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/IMG_0186.JPG" alt="Turn 2" title="Turn 2"></a></p>
<p><a href="Images/IMG_0187.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/IMG_0187.JPG" alt="Turn 2b" title="Turn 2b"></a></p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 5-3</p>

<p class="initialCap">The forces continue to close, about to missile range but the trees prevent any
bow fire this turn. The Ruffians trigger three more traps, two decoys and a pit (the black poker chip).</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 3</h3>

<p><a href="Images/IMG_0193.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/IMG_0193.JPG" alt="Turn 3" title="Turn 3"></a></p>
<p><a href="Images/IMG_0189.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/IMG_0189.JPG" alt="Turn 3" title="Turn 3"></a></p>
<p><a href="Images/IMG_0192.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/IMG_0192.JPG" alt="Turn 3" title="Turn 3"></a></p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 3-1.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Three Ruffian bowmen make half moves so they can fire; the rest continue to make their
way through the woods.  The Hobbit archers hide behind trees as to provide only obstructed targets, while
the Militia take advantage of the cover of the central clump of trees.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Left Image: The Ruffian's progress. If you look carefully you can see a Hobbit archer
in the distance, and the stands of the Militia behind the woods.  Middle Image: The sides are getting close!
Right Image: the playing area as viewed from the Good baseline.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Most of the arrows miss; each side gets one hit which then fails to wound.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 4</h3>

<p><a href="Images/IMG_0197.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/IMG_0197.JPG" alt="Turn 4" title="Turn 4"></a></p>
<p><a href="Images/IMG_0198.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/IMG_0198.JPG" alt="Turn 4" title="Turn 4"></a></p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 5-2.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Hobbits, moving first, consider their options and decide to stand pat.  The
Ruffians are still over a move away, so there is no threat of melee this turn.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Ruffians forge ahead, going through three more traps.  Two are decoys, but
another Ruffian lands in a pit.  The Ruffians are now easily within a move of the Hobbit Militia, which
also means they are within range of thrown stones.</p>

<p class="initialCap">But again all the missiles again miss but one Hobbit arrow, which, again, fails to
wound.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Ruffians are now two-thirds of the way across the board, and have yet to
take a casualty.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 5</h3>

<p><a href="Images/IMG_0200.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/IMG_0200.JPG" alt="Turn 5" title="Turn 5"></a></p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 4-3.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Moving first, the Hobbits retreat out of melee range.  At least as best they can;
two Ruffians manage to catch up to the militia.  They cross over a trap as they do so, but it
inevitably turns out to be a decoy and so is no help to the little guys.</p>

<p class="initialCap">All missiles and whips miss, but in the subsequent melee the honors go to Evil
as one of the Militia falls.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 6</h3>

<p><a href="Images/IMG_0202.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/IMG_0202.JPG" alt="Turn 6" title="Turn 6"></a></p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 3-2.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Ruffians swarm the Hobbits. Amazingly, despite the odds the only casualty
is a Hobbit archer.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 7</h3>

<p><a href="Images/IMG_0205.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/IMG_0205.JPG" alt="Turn 7" title="Turn 7"></a></p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 5-1.</p>

<p class="initialCap">It's Hobbit-swarming time again. One Ruffian archer triggers a trap and ends
up hanging from a tree, but that's small consolation for the loss of another Militia.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 8</h3>

<p><a href="Images/IMG_0207.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/IMG_0207.JPG" alt="Turn 8" title="Turn 8"></a></p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 6-5.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Surrounded by Ruffians, the Hobbits have no place to run. The two remaining guys
are put out of their misery and the Ruffians leisurely exit all ten men a few turns later for a decisive
victory.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Post-game Thoughts</h3>

<p class="initialCap">That was pretty unsatisfying. Since I was playing this solo, I rolled randomly for
what the traps were, which worked to the Hobbits' disadvantage.  And their die rolling was not spectacular.
But the Ruffians are half again as fast, outnumber the Hobbits 2-1, and the traps are mostly delaying devices
which don't matter a lot in the long run because there's no time pressure at all in this scenario.</p>

<p class="initialCap">I can accept that scenarios don't need to be balanced 50/50, but I think this one's
completely out of whack.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Were I to try this again (not likely), I'd consider some or all of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Adding Paladin Took to the Hobbit force, primarily to give the Good player a Might Point.
  <li>Restricting the Ruffians to half-moves (because it's deep forest and hence difficult terrain, but the
      Hobbits are assumed to know the forest so well that they can still move 4")
  <li>Allowing the Hobbits to charge enemies that they can't see at the beginning of their move, so they
      can hide in a forest clump and still ambush the Ruffians.
  <li>Add 3 (or more?) archers to the hobbit force.
</ul>

<p class="initialCap">Anyone have any counterarguments as to the lopsidedness of this scenario?</p>

<p class="initialCap">It does look pretty impressive with all the trees, though.</p>
