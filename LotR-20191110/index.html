<h1>The Death of Lotho</h1>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<p class="initialCap">This is the sixth scenario from Games Workshop's <i>Scouring of the Shire</i> (2019) source book for
their <i>Middle Earth Strategy Battle Game</i>.  Worm tries to assassinate Lotho Sackville-Baggins. If he succeeds, Evil wins.
If Lotho escapes off any board edge, Good wins.  Any other result (e.g. Lotho killed by Ruffians) is a draw.</p>

<h3>The Forces</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_1601.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1601.JPG" alt="Good Forces" title="Good Forces" width="250" height="188"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_1602.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1602.JPG" alt="Evil Forces" title="Evil Forces" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">The Good force is (improbably, given his odiousness) Lotho Sackville-Baggins leading eight Hobbit Militia.  Evil
is six Ruffians, three whipmen, and Worm.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Setup</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_1603.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1603.JPG" alt="Setup" title="Setup" width="250" height="188"></a>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Lotho is placed in the center of the 2'x2' board, with his Militia within 3&quot;.  The Ruffians set up
outside Charge range.  Worm doesn't begin on map; instead, the four black markers on the center of each table edge (only three
visible in the picture) represent the possibility of Worm.  When they Engage, they turn out be decoys on a dieroll of 1-4 or actually
Worm on a 5-6.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 1</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_1605.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1605.JPG" alt="Turn 1" title="Turn 1" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">It's tempting for the hobbits to stay put and chuck stones.  Odds are that two Ruffians will be killed and bagging
even more is possible.  But it seems better to get moving.  Moving 4&quot; while the Ruffians move 6&quot; means the Ruffians
being run away from only catch up 2&quot; per turn.  If the hobbits stay put, the Ruffians catch up 6&quot; instead and are poised
for Combat that much quicker.  So Good makes a run for it.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Ruffians that can Charge, ganging up on a single hobbit to maximize the chances of a kill.  That tactic
pays off as the hobbit goes down.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Casualties: Good 1, Evil 0</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 2</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_1607.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1607.JPG" alt="Turn 2" title="Turn 2" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 4-2.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The hobbits move to obstruct the Ruffians. By scenario special rule the Militia must Charge if they can, but here
that's what they would want to do anyway to keep the bad guys from reaching Lotho.  But they can't obstruct the Worm marker (also
by scenario special rule) and it Charges Lotho.  The reveal dieroll is a '5' -- it's Worm!</p>

<p class="initialCap">Combat favors Good.  Although two outnumbered hobbits are taken out, two Militia take out their opposing
Ruffians, and Lotho wins his Combat against Worm and succeeds in getting a Wound.  Sans Fate, Worm is dead!  No Evil victory is now
possible.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Casualties: Good 3, Evil 4</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 3</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_1609.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1609.JPG" alt="Turn 3" title="Turn 3" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 5-2.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Lotho calls a Heroic Move using the only Might point in the game.  His movement is somewhat constrained because
the Militia must Charge if they can but also must be within 6&quot; of Lotho at the end of the Movement phase.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Combat is all Evil this turn, with three hobbits dying, even in the Combat where the Militia was 2:1 against the
Ruffian.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Casualties: Good 6, Evil 4</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 4</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_1610.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1610.JPG" alt="Turn 4" title="Turn 4" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 6-4.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Lotho can't <i>quite</i> get off board.  The Militia Charge the only Ruffians who can reach him while the
other Ruffians move up in hopes of snagging Priority next turn and attacking Lotho before he escapes.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The brave Militia loses the fight but the Ruffians apparently feel sorry for the little fella as no Wounds
are scored.</p>

<p class="initialCap">I'm not quite sure what happened to the orange-hatted Militia from last turn.  It looks like I accidentally
removed him as a casualty even though he survived.  For better or worse, it doesn't matter to the outcome of the game.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Casualties: Good 6, Evil 4</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 5</h3>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 4-2.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Lotho waltzes off the board.  Good victory!</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Post-game Thoughts</h3>

<p class="initialCap">Well, I can't say that one overstayed its welcome.  It felt a little counter to the spirit of the scenario
to have Worm emerge so early, and then to have Lotho dispatch him so easily.  Worm gets a boost to his Fight Value and Attacks when
only his Combat opponent is within 6&quot; of him, but that wasn't close to the case here.  You could rule that Engaged models don't
count for sighting Worm, which means he would have gotten that bonus after all. But then you have Worm likely killing Lotho on Turn 2.
Would that have been any better a game?</p>

<p class="initialCap">Perhaps it was a mistake to move in the Worm marker as early as I did.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Exciting and thematic enough (although counter to book lore) but not particularly deep.</p>
