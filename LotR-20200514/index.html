<h1>Grishnákh's End</h1>

<div align="center">

</div>

<p class="initialCap">This is a scenario of Games Workshop's <i>Middle
Earth Strategy Battle Game</i> from the
<i>War in Rohan</i> sourcebook.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Rohirrim have slain the orcs holding Merry and Pippin prisoner.  In the melee the hobbits
have escaped into the forest of Fangorn. But one orc has survived: Grishnákh has their scent and follows them into
the woods.</p>

<p class="initialCap">This is a chase scenario not using the usual SBG rules. Instead of having a fixed movement
rate, each model draws a card from a deck of standard playing cards.  Hobbits move half the card's rank (rounded up);
Grishnákh does the same but, being faster, gets a 1&quot; bonus to his move.<p>

<p class="initialCap">Face cards give the drawing model a special action.  The hobbits can throw stones, climb
Treebeard, or wake Treebeard (who is initially asleep and doesn't participate until woken).  Grishnákh can sprint 6&quot;,
or pull a hobbit down off Treebeard.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Combat uses the normal SBG stats and rules.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The game continues until either the hobbits or Grishnákh are dead.</p>

<h3>The Forces</h3>

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">There's no need for separate Good and Evil pictures for a scenario this small. There are only four
participants: Treebeard, Merry, Pippin, and Grishnákh.  The scenario doesn't mention it but Merry and Pippin should probably be
unarmed.  I used unarmed models for flavor but kept to the letter of the rules and didn't enforce the -1 Duel roll penalty for
the hobbits.</p>

<h3>Setup</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_1947.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1947.JPG" alt="Setup" title="Setup" width="250" height="188"></a>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">The board is a smallish 2'x2'.  Treebeard sets up on the east edge, Grishnákh on the west, and the
hobbits in the center.  Given that this is a chase scenario, I thought a camera angle from over Grishnákh's shoulder
would be most interesting.</p>

<p class="initialCap">I also made some stop-motion movies to show each turn's action. This would be impractical for an SBG
scenario of any real size but it's pretty manageable here.  You'll have to forgive the occasional knocked tree in
the movies; you can just pretend they are huorns.</p>

<h3>Turn 1</h3>

<p>
<video style="float:left" controls="controls" width="250" height="188" name="Turn 1" src="Movies/Turn1.mov">Video not available</video>
<a href="Images/IMG_1962.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1962.JPG" alt="Turn 1" title="Turn 1" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Merry: Ace (1&quot;)</p>
<p class="initialCap">Pippin: 6 (3&quot;)</p>
<p class="initialCap">Grishnákh: 4 (3&quot;)</p>

<p class="initialCap">Not a bad first turn for Good. Keep this up and Grishnákh won't stand a chance. In the video, Merry falls over
just because that's my head canon for why he moved so slowly this turn: he tripped while being pursued, as in a horror movie.
There are no game ramifications.</p>

<h3>Turn 2</h3>

<p>
<video style="float:left" controls="controls" width="250" height="188" name="Turn 2" src="Movies/Turn2.mov">Video not available</video>
<a href="Images/IMG_1990.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1990.JPG" alt="Turn 2" title="Turn 2" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Merry: Jack (Throw Stone)</p>
<p class="initialCap">Pippin: 8 (4&quot;)</p>
<p class="initialCap">Grishnákh: King (6&quot;)</p>

<p class="initialCap">Merry stoops for a stone (as he can't climb or wake Treebeard) but Grishnákh is out of range.  Pippin nears
Treebeard, and Grishnákh finds his wind.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 3</h3>

<p>
<video style="float:left" controls="controls" width="250" height="188" name="Turn 3" src="Movies/Turn3.mov">Video not available</video>
<a href="Images/IMG_2004.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_2004.JPG" alt="Turn 3" title="Turn 3" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Merry: Jack (Throw Stone)</p>
<p class="initialCap">Pippin: 8 (4&quot;)</p>
<p class="initialCap">Grishnákh: 2 (2&quot;)</p>

<p class="initialCap">Merry bravely throws another stone.  He hits but the missile bounces off the orc's armor.  But evidently it makes
Grishnákh think twice, and he advances on tiptoe. Pippin reaches Treebeard and now is looking for face cards in the coming turns.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 4</h3>

<p>
<video style="float:left" controls="controls" width="250" height="188" name="Turn 4" src="Movies/Turn4.mov">Video not available</video>
<a href="Images/IMG_2021.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_2021.JPG" alt="Turn 4" title="Turn 4" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Merry: King (Throw Stone)</p>
<p class="initialCap">Pippin: 7 (no effect)</p>
<p class="initialCap">Grishnákh: 10 (6&quot;)</p>

<p class="initialCap">Merry <i>again</i> chucks a rock. This time he hits and Wounds, but Grishnákh shrugs it off with a Fate point.
It did make him mad, though. He advances into contact with Merry.  Merry brings it to the Duel roll, beating Grishnákh '6'-'5'. But
Grishnákh spends his sole (due to scenario special rule) Might point to tie and hence win on Fight value.  He gets one Wound on the
hobbit, which is saved by Fate.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Pippin is at Treebeard's feet, searching for a way to clamber up.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 5</h3>

<p>
<video style="float:left" controls="controls" width="250" height="188" name="Turn 5" src="Movies/Turn5.mov">Video not available</video>
<a href="Images/IMG_2034.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_2034.JPG" alt="Turn 5" title="Turn 5" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Merry: Ace (1&quot;)</p>
<p class="initialCap">Pippin: 7 (no effect)</p>
<p class="initialCap">Grishnákh: Jack (6&quot;)</p>

<p class="initialCap">Merry finally decides to run, but he doesn't get far.  Grishnákh runs up, fights, wins, and inflicts two Wounds.
Merry goes down!  Pippin can only look on in despair.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 6</h3>

<p>
<video style="float:left" controls="controls" width="250" height="188" name="Turn 6" src="Movies/Turn6.mov">Video not available</video>
<a href="Images/IMG_2051.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_2051.JPG" alt="Turn 6" title="Turn 6" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Pippin: 4 (no effect)</p>
<p class="initialCap">Grishnákh: 6 (4&quot;)</p>

<p class="initialCap">Pippin still can't find a toehold. Grishnákh is alarmingly near.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 7</h3>

<p>
<video style="float:left" controls="controls" width="250" height="188" name="Turn 7" src="Movies/Turn7.mov">Video not available</video>
<a href="Images/IMG_2075.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_2075.JPG" alt="Turn 7" title="Turn 7" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Pippin: 5 (no effect)</p>
<p class="initialCap">Grishnákh: 7 (5&quot;)</p>

<p class="initialCap">I switched the camera angle to get closer in. Grishnákh catches up to Pippin, beats him in Combat, inflicts two Wounds,
and Pippin dies.  Evil Victory!</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Post-game Thoughts</h3>

<p class="initialCap">A grim ending for Good.  I guess Treebeard had an unusually deep Ent-draught before nap time.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Dirty little secret time: I'm really more of a Tolkien gamer than I am an SBG gamer.  In other words, I'm really
more interested in living vicariously in Middle Earth than I am in the specific mechanics of the SBG game.  I do, of course, appreciate
that the SBG rules give us a great community with a common "language" for recreating scenes from the books and movies.  They often work
very effectively. And I love the models.</p>

<p class="initialCap">But I'd rather play a not-strictly-SBG scenario that hews more closely to the "history" than a scenario
that tries to shoehorn the SBG mechanics into an ill-fitting situation.  So I'm a fan of GW's willingness to sometimes step outside the
bounds of the standard rules, as here.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The randomized movement really worked for recreating the feel of the chase.  There's not much one can do about the
card distribution, so this scenario can't rank highly as a tactical test. All you can do is (literally) play the cards you are dealt.  But the result
is a surprisingly tense situation, and hence an interesting change of pace.</p>

<p class="initialCap">And once you've set up you can play in ten times in an hour, with a mix of Evil and Good victories depending on
how the cards fall.  There's an outside chance that the hobbits fell Grishnákh with stones before he can catch them...</p>
