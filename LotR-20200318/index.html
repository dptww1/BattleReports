<h1>Battle of Greenfields</h1>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<p class="initialCap">Games Workshop's <i>Scouring of the Shire</i> (2019) source book for their <i>Middle Earth Strategy Battle Game</i>
contains some bonus scenarios not technically related to the title event.  Here's the first of them, the Battle of Greenfields.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Here we see Bandobras "Bullroarer" Took, who is so large he can ride a horse, fight off an attack of Warg Riders
lead by Golfimbul.  "Historically", the Bullroarer knocked off Golfimbul's head, simultaneously defeating the Orcs and inventing the
game of golf.  We'll see here whether he can recreate that feat.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The objective here is simple: reduce the other side to 25% or less.  When either leader is eliminated, the other side's
models have to take Courage Tests exactly as if their force had been broken.  Ties are possible if both sides are reduced to 25% on the
same turn.</p>

<h3>The Forces</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_1865.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1865.JPG" alt="Good Forces" title="Good Forces" width="250" height="188"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_1866.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1866.JPG" alt="Evil Forces" title="Evil Forces" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">The Good forces are Bandobras Took leading 4 Hobbit Archers, 4 Shirriffs, and 8 Hobbit Militia. Also participating, though
unbeknownst to the hobbits, are 3 Rangers of the North.  The Participants section of this scenario doesn't specify that Bandobras is on horse,
but the accompanying picture shows him mounted and I can't imagine GW omitted the mention of the horse intentionally.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Golfimbul's force is a dozen Warg Riders.</p>

<h3>Setup</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_1867.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1867.JPG" alt="Setup" title="Setup" width="250" height="188"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_1868.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1868.JPG" alt="Setup, Hobbits" title="Setup, Hobbits" width="250" height="188"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_1869.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1869.JPG" alt="Setup, Golfimbul's Riders" title="Setup, Golfimbul's Riders" width="250" height="188"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_1870.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1870.JPG" alt="Setup, Backfield" title="Setup, Backfield" width="250" height="188"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_1872.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1872.JPG" alt="Pregame Volley" title="Pregame Volley" width="250" height="188"></a>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">The board is 2'x4' (1st picture), with the edge of the Shire in the west and woods to the east.  The hobbits begin within 12&quot; of
the western edge.  Not knowing where the Warg Riders will go, they set up evenly around the forward hobbit hole (2nd picture), which divides their part of
the battlefield in half.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The bulk of the Warg Riders set up near the halfway point of the board (3rd picture), except for four riders which must set up near
the eastern board edge (4th picture, right).  The three Rangers are then set up between the two Evil contingents; Good is careful to keep them out of
immediate Charge range.</p>

<p class="initialCap">By special rule, this scenario gives the Rangers a free Shooting attack before the game starts (5th picture).  The first shot takes out
a Warg Rider bowman, whose Warg runs away.  The second shot hits another Warg Rider bowman; the Wound roll is only '4' (needing '5') but Rangers of
the North have Might points, and the shooter uses his to kill the rider.  The warg sticks around, though (hence the white marker as a reminder).  The
third shot rolls a '2' to hit (needing '3') but as Wounding is chancy the Ranger decides to save his Might.</p>

<p class="initialCap">So the game hasn't even started yet, and Evil is down one and a half casualties!</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 1</h3>

<p>

<a href="Images/IMG_1874.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1874.JPG" alt="Turn 1, Backfield" title="Turn 1, Backfield" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">As usual for narrative play, Good automatically gets Priority on Turn 1.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The hobbits would like to see what Evil does, so they (rather boringly) stay put for now.  The Rangers rearrange slightly
to avoid Charges.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil finds that one Ranger misjudged distances and is actually within Charge range.  The backfield Warg Riders Charge him,
while sending another pair off to catch the other two Rangers next turn.  The remaining Warg Riders move towards the hobbits, moving only half
so as to stay out of Throw Stones range and preserve the ability to Shoot with the two remaining bowmen.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Shooting find the Good side scarily accurate, as most of the shots hit.  But frustratingly, the only arrow to actually
score a Wound is one that takes out Golfimbul's warg (1st picture, white bead).</p>

<p class="initialCap">There's only one Combat, as the Warg Rider attacking the Ranger takes him out right handily.  Now he's wishing he'd used
his Might point to hit last turn after all.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Casualties: Good 1, Evil 1.5</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 2</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_1879.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1879.JPG" alt="Turn 2, Main Action, North" title="Turn 2, Main Action, North" width="250" height="188"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_1878.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1878.JPG" alt="Turn 2, Main Action, South" title="Turn 2, Main Action, South" width="250" height="188"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_1877.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1877.JPG" alt="Turn 2, Backfield" title="Turn 2, Backfield" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 5-4.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The two remaining Rangers are in some danger and so the one with Might left calls a Heroic Move and those Rangers half-move out
of Charge range.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Over in the main action, Evil starts in a great position, being out of Throw Stones range but within Charge range.  So: Charge!
Throwing Spears are hurled but, as usually the case, to no effect.</p>

<p class="initialCap">My playthroughs of these SotS scenarios have had so many disappointing Shoot Phases. But now Good has amazing archery: all four
shot hit <i>and</i> score Wounds!  In the following Combat, three hobbits go down but so do two Warg Riders and a Warg.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Casualties: Good 4, Evil 6</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 3</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_1881.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1881.JPG" alt="Turn 3" title="Turn 3" width="250" height="188"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_1882.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1882.JPG" alt="Turn 3, Brave Orc" title="Turn 3, Brave Orc" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 5-4.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Bullroarer considers a Heroic Move. The nearby hobbits could pin the Warg Riders, perhaps allowing him to Charge Golfimbul. But
there's not <i>quite</i> enough room for him to sneak through -- oh for a base just a millimeter smaller.  So no Heroic Move.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Starting to look pretty thin on the ground, Evil decides on a Mongol-like strategy and pulls away, hoping to use his greater
mobility to reconcentrate on the north side of the hobbit hole.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Although out of Throw Stone range, the Warg Riders can still be shot by arrows.  But Good Shooting reverts to typical and
out of four shots, only one Warg Rider is slain (1st picture, right).  The warg remains, though.</p>

<p class="initialCap">There is one Combat this turn; the Warg Rider bowman who was dismounted last turn, unable to get out of Throw Stones range,
sacrifices himself and Charges a couple of Hobbit Archers.  Outnumbered 3:1, he somehow wins his Combat, though he can't score a Wound.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Casualties: Good 4, Evil 6.5</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 4</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_1885.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1885.JPG" alt="Turn 4" title="Turn 4" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 3-2.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Charges where he can.  Bullroarer rides into Golfimbul, while a couple compatriots tie up the nearby Warg Riders. Evil
counter-Charges where he can.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Shooting has no effect.</p>

<p class="initialCap">As Combat starts, Golfimbul and Bullroarer are tied in Fight Value so both call Heroic Strikes.  The dice favor Evil, '3' vs '2',
but then Good wins the Duel roll '4' to '3'.  Golfimbul uses his last Might point to tie, and Bullroarer uses <i>his</i> last Might to force the win.
Six Wound rolls get the expected two Wounds, and Golfimbul's <i>Girth</i> rolls fail to protect him and down he goes.  Historical result achieved,
although the game is technically not over yet.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Elsewhere, two hobbits are ridden down, and the suicide Orc archer is finally slain.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Casualties: Good 6, Evil 8.5</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 5</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_1887.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1887.JPG" alt="Turn 4" title="Turn 4" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 4-3.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil now has only five models left on the field.  But since Golfimbul is dead, his models have to take Courage Tests before
moving ... and the first three models to check run away!  The two remaining models are bloody-minded and Charge Bullroarer.  The hobbits move in
to help their leader.  Evil actually wins both subsequent combats, killing a hobbit and Wounding Bullroarer.  But it's too little, too late.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Good victory!</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Post-game Thoughts</h3>

<p class="initialCap">Good had some impressive luck streaks that made this game seem more lopsided than I think it is.</p>

<p class="initialCap">In retrospect, there were a couple of things that I should have done differently. First, Golfimbul should have been better
protected from Shooting by his Warg Riders; he's much less threatening without his Warg.  Second, the Evil main force should probably join
up with the rear guard and help clear out the Rangers before engaging with the hobbits.</p>

<p class="initialCap">A fun enough scenario with an unusual setup which adds some tactical options.</p>
