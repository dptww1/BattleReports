<h1>Rescue the Baggage</h1>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<p class="initialCap">This is an introductory scenario of Games Workshop's <i>Middle
Earth Strategy Battle Game</i>, the second in the
<i>Escape From Goblintown</i> introductory rules.</p>

<h3>The Forces</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_0787.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0787.JPG" alt="Good Forces" title="Good Forces" width="250" height="188"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_0786.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0786.JPG" alt="Evil Forces" title="Evil Forces" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur are opposed by twelve Goblins led by Grinnah.  Compared to the
<a href="../LotR-20170625/">previous Goblintown scenario</a>, the dwarves are weaker (no 3 Attack tanks) and the Goblins stronger since
Grinnah has three Might points instead of the Goblin Captain's two. On the other hand there's no time pressure on Good in this scenario,
and the Goblin replacement rate is smaller.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Initial Setup</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_0788.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0788.JPG" alt="The Board" title="The Board" width="250" height="188"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_0790.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0790.JPG" alt="Setup" title="Setup" width="250" height="188"></a>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">The Goblintown scenery is arranged so that the players can get from platform to platform by walking or
by jumping across the gap.  The bottom platform is rotated 90 degrees from the book's scenario layout because without doing
so the jump-across area was too small and blocked by the platform support poles.</p>

<p class="initialCap">I've swung the camera around in the second picture to show the initial setup.  The dwarves begin at the (now) left and must make
their way to the baggage in the center of the opposite platform and carry it off the board to win.  The Goblins begin evenly divided
between the walkway and the platform.  Grinnah starts on the platform to await developments.  Evil will win if they can kill two
of the dwarves.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 1</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_0792.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0792.JPG" alt="Turn 1" title="Turn 1" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">As always, Good gets Priority on the first turn.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The dwarves decide that jumping the gap seems like a mug's game. Unless they roll a six, they end up
at the edge of the platform where they are vulnerable to being pushed off the platform (i.e. killed) if they lose a combat.
So they decide to head for the walkways, lining the edge to prevent the Goblins themselves from jumping over and surrounding them.</p>

<p class="initialCap">But the dwarves can't both make forward progress and man the platform edge, so there's a little gap and
one Goblin jumps over anyway.  He rolls a 6 on his Jump test and so could attack Bifur, but a lone Goblin against even these weaker dwarves seems unlikely to
end well. So he makes threatening moves but doesn't engage.</p>

<p class="initialCap">On the walkways, two Goblins are close enough to tackle Bombur this turn.  The dice go to Evil, 6-4.  Bombur
could win the fight but only at the cost of both his Might points, and declines to do so.  So the Goblins win, but fortunately
for the stout dwarf they are unable to wound.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 2</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_0794.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0794.JPG" alt="Turn 2" title="Turn 2" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 6-2.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Spread out as they are, the dwarves are vulnerable to being trapped, so Bofur calls a Heroic Move.  He
moves to the rear while Bombur and Bifur tackle the walkway.  (At this point I realized that the pole on the platform makes
the entrance to the walkway a single base width, so Bifur is better as a backup because he has a spear and so can help Bombur
in combat.)</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Goblins swarm.  Another one jumps the gap and rolls another 6, so he and last turn's jumper charge
Bofur.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Bofur is trapped and, because of his two-handed weapon, is -1 on his attack dice.  Both sides roll two
dice and Bofur lucks out 6-4 and then kills both attackers.  That was a close call.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Bomber also wins his fight and takes out another Goblin.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Casualties: Good 0, Evil 3.  No Goblins come back this turn.  Not a bad turn for the dwarves.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 3</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_0797.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0797.JPG" alt="Turn 3" title="Turn 3" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 3-3.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Bombur and Bifur advance, trying to make <i>some</i> sort of progress.  Bofur continues to rearguard.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil can't afford to just let Good hack down eight Goblins; we saw what happened last time when Evil
had to start taking Courage tests.  So to bring the fight to the dwarves, the Goblins hanging back on the platform move to
jump the gap.  Two more warriors make it over but there are no sixes this time and they must stop to regain their balance after
they land.</p>

<p class="initialCap">In the lone combat this turn, Good muffs the roll 4-5, so Bifur spends a Might point to win and the dwarves
kill two more Goblins.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Casualties: Good 0, Evil 5.  One dead Goblin comes back.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 4</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_0799.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0799.JPG" alt="Turn 4" title="Turn 4" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 4-2.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Bombur calls a Heroic Move, but this time Grinnah counters and the rolloff goes to Evil.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Grinnah jumps the gap but rolls a '3' and can't engage.  But the other jumpers can, and they
charge Bifur and Bofur.  Bombur then advances, figuring an inch of progress is better than nothing.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Bofur's luck runs out as his combat roll of 2 is beaten by the Goblin's 5.  He can't Might that to a win,
so he has to retreat -- but he's trapped, so he's pushed off the edge and dies.  One down, one to go for Evil.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Bifur, the one you'd hope takes a wound because then he gets free Heroic Combats, disappointly(?) wins
and slays his enemy.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Bombur also loses 5-6.  Desperately, he uses his last Might point to force the win. But he manages to
take out only one of the mob swarming him.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Casualties: Good 1, Evil 7.  Two dead Goblins return.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 5</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_0801.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0801.JPG" alt="Turn 5" title="Turn 5" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 6-5.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Things are looking pretty grim for Good.  Bofur is dead, Bombur has no Might, Bifur is down to one Might.
Bifur could call a Heroic Move, but then what? Grinnah still has two Might points and the Goblins' positional advantage is overwhelming.
What could the dwarves do to negate that? So no Heroic Move from Good.</p>

<p class="initialCap">In combat, Bombur loses (again?) but despite eight strikes (because he's trapped) he takes only one Wound.</p>

<p class="initialCap">But Bombur's perserverance doesn't matter because Bifur goes down to Grinnah's Heroic Strike.  With two dwarves
dead, Evil wins.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Post-game Thoughts</h3>

<p class="initialCap">I didn't like that as much as the last one.  The dwarves need to break the Evil army
but these characters don't have the oomph to make that happen.  It seems to me that Good's luck was probably
below average in this game, though.</p>
