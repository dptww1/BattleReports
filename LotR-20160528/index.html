<h1>Roast Mutton</h1>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<p class="initialCap">This is a scenario of Games Workshop's <i>Hobbit Strategy
Battle Game</i>, from the <i>An Unexpected Journey</i> rulebook.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Bilbo and Thorin's Company investigate a
campfire in the Trollshaws and come upon Bert, William, and Tom, three
enormous trolls.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Both sides are in a race against the dawn, which occurs on a 3+ starting on turn 7.
The trolls win if they capture and/or kill all of the dwarves.  The dwarves win if they kill all three
trolls.  Interestingly(?), Bilbo is entirely irrelevant to victory for either side.</p>

<p class="initialCap">I made a couple of rules changes because as written the scenario
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo23ETd11oI&index=1&list=PLeIywh8H3Kc7fiaGLheYUBXCfAaqzMvvw">doesn't seem to make a very good game</a>:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The dwarves enter from the same board edge where Kili sets up.</li>
  <li>Dwarves enter on a dieroll of 5+, and must continue rolling each turn (i.e. no auto-entry after turn 1)</li>
</ul>

<p class="initialCap">These changes are intended to introduce a trickle of dwarves as the game proceeds, which is rather closer to the books
than the rules as written, where the trolls get mobbed right from the start.</p>

<h3>The Forces</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_0532.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0532.JPG" alt="The Trolls" title="The Trolls"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_0534.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0534.JPG" alt="Thorin's Company & Bilbo" title="Thorin's Company & Bilbo"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Meet Bert, Tom, and Bill (left to right).  I understand that Games Workshop and the movie disagree
on which troll is which, but I have a hard enough time remembering who's who without having to remember the proper
name substitutions as well. So I'm going with GW's naming.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Between <a href="../LotR-20160507/">my last game</a> and this one I'm almost at the point of knowing who is who in Thorin's
Company.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Though the trolls are fearsome both figuratively and literally, Thorin's company is pretty tough also and has a
25-6 advantage in Might. I think this is going to be an uphill battle for Evil.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Setup</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_0537.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0537.JPG" alt="Setup" title="Setup"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">The trolls begin touching their campfire.  Bilbo begins 3 inches away away from Bill, and by scenario special rule
need not fear evil attacks for the first two turns unless he himself attacks the trolls.  Kili begins on a board edge.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 1</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_0539.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0539.JPG" alt="Turn 1" title="Turn 1"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">As always, Good starts a scenario with Priority.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Bilbo runs to the safety (perhaps) of his friends.  Balin, Bofur, Ori, and Fili enter.  The trolls run after Bilbo
and, not coincidentally, towards the dwarves.  Kili takes a potshot at Tom but misses.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 2</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_0542.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0542.JPG" alt="Turn 2" title="Turn 2"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 5-5.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The trolls change strategies and stoop for stones.  The trolls are likely to win a shooting war, so threatening to
pelt the dwarves from afar forces the dwarves to come to them.  The dwarves accordingly continue to advance, except for Ori who remains
stationary to maximize his slingshot potential.  The heavy hitters Gloin, Dori, Thorin, and Dwalin all enter this turn.  Bilbo continues to run.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Shooting is anticlimatic as all the shots are wide of their mark.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 3</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_0544.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0544.JPG" alt="Turn 3" title="Turn 3"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 6-4.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The trolls, disappointed in their failure to even hit with stones last turn (5+ is pretty weak) decide to advance
again to tempt some dwarves into combat.  The eligible dwarves charge, except for Ori, who stays back to shoot, and Balin, who fails his
terror test.  Even Bilbo gets into the action, manuevering so as to stab Bill in the back.</p>

<p class="initialCap">None of the remaining four dwarves enter.  Those trolls do look pretty daunting.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Ori's slingshot gets a '6' to hit and so he auto-wounds Tom, who rolls for his Fate point and gets a '3'.  He deems
it not worth using a Might point to pass and takes the wound.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Fili's brave solo attack against Bert runs into bad luck as he manages just a '2' highest against Bert's '4'.  Bert wins
and decides to Keep Fili for Later.  One down, twelve to go!</p>

<p class="initialCap">Kili, Bofur, and Bilbo tackle Bill.  Kili does a Heroic Strike and gets to Fight 10, so he'll win ties.  Bill sets the bar at '6'
and Good manages only a '5' highest from Kili, who Mights it up to '6' to win the combat.  Bill's special <i>Magic Purse</i> rule prevents
double strikes, and neither Kili nor Bilbo manage to wound, but between Bofur's 2-handed weapon's bonus and a Might point, he puts
two wounds on Bill, whose Fate point fails.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Fili rolls to recover from his paralysis (needing a 6) but fails.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 4</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_0546.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0546.JPG" alt="Turn 4" title="Turn 4"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 6-4.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The dwarves swarm the trolls, everyone passing their Courage tests. Bombur and Oin enter play.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Thorin, Dwalin, Kili, and Bilbo are arrayed against Bill.  Thorin does a Heroic Strike and Bill counters.  The rolls are
disastrous for Good, with Bill getting '6' against Thorin's '1'.  Bill of course then rolls the '6' in combat and wins regardless of the Good
side's roll due to highest Fight value!  Bill decides to Mince Thorin Fine and between his better dierolling and higher Strength he delivers
four wounds on Thorin.  Things finally break Thorin's way and his three Fate points counter two of the wounds, leaving Thorin alive but
fairly well bloodied.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Only Bofur was able to reach Tom, who wins 4-3. Bofur is out of Might and hence can't change the results despite Tom's
mediocre roll.  Tom decides to Keep Bofur For Later.  Two down, ten to go!</p>

<p class="initialCap">Dori and Balin go in against Bert. Dori's Heroic Strike roll is '5' and so when the duel rolls are tied at '5', the dwarves
win. Balin scores a wound (so what was he afraid of last turn?) which Bert's Fate roll fails to prevent.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Kili stays paralyzed despite Gloin's help, but Bofur recovers right away.  More of a "stun" than a "paralyze" if you
ask me.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 5</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_0548.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0548.JPG" alt="Turn 5" title="Turn 5"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 3-2.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Worried about being surrounded, the trolls retreat so that not all the dwarves can charge this turn.  The dwarves
decide to concentrate on Bill rather than spread themselves thin against all three trolls, so Tom and Bert are left alone this turn.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Nori and Bifur still cannot be persuaded to join the fray.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Ori shoots at Tom, rolls a '5', and uses his sole Might point to get the auto-wounding '6'.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Thorin and Bill both use Might points to Heroic Strike, and both succeed in getting to Fight 10.  Unfortunately
for Evil, Bill rolls a tragic 3,1,1 and the Good side easily wins.  Between good rolls to wound, Dwalin's two-handed weapon bonus,
and a Might point, Bill is killed.</p>

<p class="initialCap">To add insult to injury, Fili recovers from his paralysis.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 6</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_0550.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0550.JPG" alt="Turn 6" title="Turn 6"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 1-1.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The dwarves attack. Bifur and Nori continue to skulk.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Gloin and Bert call Heroic Strikes, and both get to Fight 10. But Bert's duel roll is a sad '4' highest and he is easily
beaten.  Between Gloin, Balin, and Fili, Bert is pretty easily slain.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Tom and Thorin also call Heroic Strikes, but here the result is very different, as Tom's poor dieroll of '2' is
still better than Thorin's disappointing '1'.  Tom will be the victor in any tied fights and, sure enough, Tom gets his '6' in the duel and wins!
What to do?  He considers Hurling Thorin, but S3 hits aren't likely to do much damage to the tough dwarves.  Instead he decides to use his
personal special rule to Squash Them to Jelly.  Surprisingly, lower-defenced Bofur takes no damage, but the S7 hit against Fate-less Thorin scores
a wound and kills him!</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 7</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_0551.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0551.JPG" alt="Turn 7" title="Turn 7"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 5-3.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Gandalf has trouble summoning the sun, rolling only a '2'.  Good actually wants the game to continue at
this point so that they can slay Tom for the win, so the dwarves breath a sigh of relief and prepare for the charge....</p>

<p class="initialCap">... only to have Tom bravely run away!  Why stick around for a hopeless battle?</p>

<p class="initialCap">The dwarves give chase, barring Kili and Ori who shoot and hit but cannot score a wound.  Nori finally
enters the game, to no effect at this point.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 8</h3>

<p class="initialCap">Gandalf rolls a '4', the sun comes up, and the game is over.  It's a draw by the letter of the rules,
but having a troll survive while managing to outright kill Thorin seems like at least a moral victory for Evil.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Post-game Thoughts</h3>

<p class="initialCap">Even with my revisions, this doesn't seem like a very satisfactory scenario.  Given average luck on
the sunrise rolls, the scenario should run eight turns, which means the trolls need to be capturing or killing three dwarves
every two turns. Barring rigged dice, that is lottery-winningly impossible.</p>

<p class="initialCap">So the trolls need to be more effective.  Here are some angles to approach that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Lower the arrival rate of the dwarves to 6+.</li>

  <li>Remove the ability of paralyzed dwarves to revive themselves.  In the above game, that would
likely have taken Fili and Bofur out of the game, perhaps helping the trolls to survive a bit longer.</li>

  <li>Get rid of the sunrise rule, or at least adjust it so that the game doesn't end so soon. I like that there's a bit of
  time pressure -- both sides need to do <i>something</i> or the game is a draw -- but given the damage and kill rates
  the current rule tends to promote draws.</li>
</ol>

<p class="initialCap">The situation is just oozing with theme.  I think there's a good scenario somewhere in here, just trying to get out.</p>
