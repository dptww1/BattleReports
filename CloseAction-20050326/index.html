<h1>Trincomolee, September 1782</h1>
    
<hr>
    
<p class="initialCap">This 18th century naval battle was fought
using the <a href="http://www.clashofarms.com/close-act.html">Close
Action</a> rules.  The game designer, Mark Campbell, refereed,
and provided the ship miniatures, which make a great spectacle.

<p class="initialCap">This particular battle was fought between the British (dark blue
bases) and French (light blue bases) using their Indian Ocean squadrons,
with much overlap from the <a href="../CloseAction-20050116/">previous
game</a>.  The post-game wrap-up was definitely in the French favor, so
much so that the discussion topic seemed to center on how to give the
British a chance. 

<p class="initialCap">I was again running the 70-gun <em>Burford</em> for the British, which
explains why many of the photos center around that ship.

<h3>Initial Setup and Scatter</h3>

<p class="initialCap">Notice the difference between the "Before Scatter" and "After Scatter"
shots; the French had a -2 drm on their rolls, and had to roll twice, which
made a delightfully shambolic-looking line.

<h3>After Turn 4</h3>

<p class="initialCap">The French made a parallel line as best they could, with the weaker frigates
<em>Consolante</em> and <em>Flamand</em> definitely hanging back.  The British began 
reversing course again.

<br style="clear: both">

<h3>After Turn 5</h3>

<p class="initialCap">Since the fleets were now on parallel courses in opposite directions, the lead ships
were moving out of the battle for a few turns.

<h3>After Turn 6</h3>
<p class="initialCap">The French turned line abreast and sailed for the British line again, while the
British were under orders to follow <em>Exeter</em> in sailing around the rear of
the French fleet.

<br style="clear: both">

<h3>After Turn 7</h3>
<p class="initialCap">The French continued their advance on the British line....getting close!  The
main action was clearly occurring at the rear of the British line, which because of
<em>Burford</em>'s location and trying to take pictures was hard for me to keep
track of, so I don't have much narrative to relate about it, unfortunately.

<p class="initialCap">You can see that two French ships (<em>Sphinx</em> &amp; <em>Heros</em>) are
heading for the same hex, an incident that recurred amusingly often.  Not that it
stopped them from winning in the end, mind you.

<br style="clear: both">

<h3>After Turn 8</h3>
<p class="initialCap">The serious scrum began this turn, and though the location and participants
changed, there was rarely a lull in the fighting.  The French continue to have
some difficulties getting their line together, but they have succeeding in
concentrating 9 battle ships against the rearmost 5 British ships, with the British
van effectively out of the battle for another few turns as we tack into the wind.

<p class="initialCap">I say "we" because around this time for better or worse <em>Burford</em>, under
orders to follow <em>Exeter</em> in line ahead formation, had effectively joined
the van squadron.

<p class="initialCap">From looking at the pins, <em>Monmouth</em> and <em>St-Michel</em> lost hull
sections this turn.

<br style="clear: both">

<h3>After Turn 9</h3>

<p class="initialCap">The British van turned into the wind and lost all momentum.

<p class="initialCap">The British rear squadron actually was fighting against something like even odds on
this turn.  However, the French rear was running with the wind, the British van against,
so time was on the French side.

<p class="initialCap">The pins show <em>Orient</em> and <em>Brilliant</em> losing rigging sections, and
<em>Eagle</em> and <em>St-Michel</em> losing both hull and rigging sections.

<br style="clear: both">

<h3>After Turn 10</h3>

<p class="initialCap">Entertainingly, ships of the British fleet are now facing in five out of six possible
headings.  We had definitely lost cohesion by this point, which given French numerically
superiority allowed us to get picked off one by one.

<p class="initialCap">The British van got wind back in their sails.  <em>Burford</em> probably turned
too soon.  On the one hand, we were supposed to form a line, in which case I should've
proceded further down wind before cutting over.  But on the other hand I
didn't want to run my ship out of the battle, so I figured I could resume my place
once I'd finished the turn.

<br style="clear: both">

<h3>After Turn 11</h3>

<p class="initialCap">The British van is now in the formation technically known as "a clump".  <em>Burford</em>
and <em>Sultan</em> look like they're going to ram each other, but the wind direction
will prevent any untoward mishap.

<p class="initialCap">The French rear squadron was now able to make its numbers felt.

<p class="initialCap">
<a href="Images/smIMG_0905.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0905.jpg" alt="Pic"></a>

<br style="clear: both">

<h3>After Turn 12</h3>

<p class="initialCap">The British bumper-car antics continue, with <em>Superb</em> joining the fray.

<p class="initialCap">The four ships in the British rear are now being fired on by seven French ships,
including little <em>Consolante</em>, who was heading towards the British van as
fast as her sails would carry her.  Very brave!

<p class="initialCap">
<a href="Images/smIMG_0911.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0911.jpg" alt="Pic"></a>
<a href="Images/smIMG_0912.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0912.jpg" alt="Pic"></a>

<a href="Images/smIMG_0914.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0914.jpg" alt="Pic"></a>

<br style="clear: both">

<h3>After Turn 13</h3>

<p class="initialCap">The wind speed had dropped from 3 to 2.  This really hurt the British van as it
tried to crawl upwind.  <em>Superb</em> veered off from <em>Burford</em>, which saved
us from collision but put another turn or two delay until one of our best ships
could get into the battle.

<p class="initialCap">
<a href="Images/smIMG_0915.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0915.jpg" alt="Pic"></a>

<br style="clear: both">

<h3>After Turn 14</h3>

<p class="initialCap"><em>Burford</em> got a rake from impudent <em>Consolante</em>, which was in turn
punished by <em>Hero</em>.

<p class="initialCap">The French rear squadron manuevered to get to the port of the British van, which
took them away from some opportunity to pound the British rear.  But the remainder
of the French were doing a good job of that anyhow and probably didn't need the help.

<p class="initialCap"><em>S&eacute;v&egrave;re</em> and <em>Worcester</em> took a heavy beating, each
losing a hull section.  <em>Eagle</em> was down two hull sections by now.

<p class="initialCap">
<a href="Images/smIMG_0917.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0917.jpg" alt="Pic"></a>

<br style="clear: both">

<h3>After Turn 15</h3>

<p class="initialCap">The British are gradually getting their formation into some semblance of order,
but <em>Burford</em> is misplaced.  I remember on this turn getting the order to
slow down to fall in behind the van, but I greedily wanted to make sure I was
placed to rake <em>S&eacute;v&egrave;re</em> if she in turn tried to rake <em>Worcester</em>.
So I plotted "2" for next turn anyway.

<p class="initialCap"><em>Eagle</em> received the concentrated short-range fire of three French ships.  She
took three morale checks and ended up striking.  Not what you want when you force is
already outnumbered.

<br style="clear: both">

<h3>After Turn 16</h3>

<p class="initialCap">As it turned out, <em>S&eacute;v&egrave;re</em> avoided the rake and I just ended up
in the way of <em>Exeter</em>.  At least from a gunnery standpoint it was probably
better to have a 70-gun B-quality ship firing at <em>S&eacute;v&egrave;re</em> than
a 64-gun C-quality ship.  But positionally it was obviously not my finest hour, as
subsequent moves show.

<p class="initialCap"><em>Sceptre</em> got a stern rake on <em>Consolante</em>, who spent the rest of
the battle running off the map .  We had her down to a "G" morale but she escaped
before we could force her to strike.

<p class="initialCap"><em>Magnanime</em> and <em>Sultan</em> got into great position against
<em>Art&eacute;sian</em>, and managed to start a fire aboard her.  Makes a great little
visual.

<p class="initialCap">Given the positions, and with <em>Art&eacute;sian</em> and <em>Consolante</em> to
balance against loss of the <em>Eagle</em>, British fortunes seemed reasonable.

<h3>After Turn 17</h3>

<p class="initialCap"><em>Art&eacute;sian</em> continued to beat the odds and failed to put out her fire.

<br style="clear: both">

<h3>After Turn 18</h3>

<p class="initialCap"><em>Burford</em> lost her first hull section thanks to <em>Illustre</em>.

<p class="initialCap"><em>S&eacute;v&egrave;re</em> grappled <em>Worcester</em>, while <em>Heros</em>
ran afoul of <em>Sultan</em>, unfortunately with the latter in raking position.

<p class="initialCap">The French rear looked like it had a "every ship for itself" order.  <em>Vengeur</em>
went downwind to meet <em>Superb</em>, while the others remained behind without
agreeing on exactly who would to try to break the British line.

<p class="initialCap">

<br style="clear: both">

<h3>After Turn 19</h3>

<p class="initialCap">With the British van actually getting into a line and turning about,
<em>Sphinx</em> found herself the target of three ships...but not <em>Burford</em>.
I figured the other three ships could handle <em>Sphinx</em> on their own, so I
took the bow rake on <em>Ajax</em>.  Another mistake, probably.  Still, <em>Sphinx</em>
took three morale checks and failed two; with "E" morale and no place to run she
was clearly in trouble.

<p class="initialCap">At the other end of the line, <em>Sultan</em> was clearly getting the better of
<em>Heros</em>, but <em>Petit-Hannibal</em> in turn was raking <em>Sultan</em> so
the overall honors were about even.

<p class="initialCap">But the most memorable point in the turn was when <em>S&eacute;v&egrave;re</em>
boarded <em>Worcester</em>.  She had a 20% chance of taking over the ship, and managed
to pull it off!  With <em>Eagle</em> struck and <em>Worcester</em> captured, it was
clearly going to be an uphill battle for the British, but we fought on.

<p class="initialCap">On the other hand, <em>Art&eacute;sian</em>'s fire continued to burn out of control,
so that was some consolation.

<br style="clear: both">

<h3>After Turn 20</h3>

<p class="initialCap">At the far end of the line, <em>Vengeur</em> and <em>Superb</em> began what turned
out to be pretty much a one-on-one duel.  My sense was that <em>Superb</em> was
winning, but of course (being a British captain) I would say that, wouldn't I?

<p class="initialCap"><em>Sphinx</em> continued to get more attention than she wanted; at some point
over the next turn or two she fell to "G" morale and was clearly close to striking.

<p class="initialCap">Turn 20's highlight was <em>Art&eacute;sian</em> getting another fire for failure
to put out the first fire after five turns (a.k.a. the "Thank you, sir, may I have
another!" rule).

<h3>After Turn 21</h3>

<p class="initialCap">The British in my section of the line were back to clump formation.  <em>Vengeur</em>
failed two morale checks and was down to "E" morale.

<h3>After Turn 22</h3>

<p class="initialCap"><em>Art&eacute;sian</em> finally managed to put out one of her fires.  Neighboring
ships were preparing for an explosion, just in case.

<h3>After Turn 24 &amp; wrapup</h3>

<p class="initialCap">Yep, that's <em>Burford</em> out of position at the far end of the line.

<br style="clear: both">

<p class="initialCap">Consensus was the French won rather obviously, capturing <em>Worcester</em> and
causing <em>Eagle</em> to strike.  Among the definitely hurting were <em>Sultan</em>,
<em>Art&eacute;sian</em>, <em>Sphinx</em>, <em>Consolante</em>, and <em>Petit-Hannibal</em>.

<p class="initialCap">It was lots of fun, though!
