<p class="initialCap">A few days after trying this scenario solo
for the <a href="../LotR-20050808/">first time</a> I decided to try again.
The models are still the same but I decided to use some unbased trees
to thicken out the forest, along with the rules modification that the
priority player no longer controls the Ringwraith; if the Good side
wants to influence its movement, a hobbit has to successfully throw
a stone.

<h3>Turns 1-3</h3>

<p><a href="Images/thIMG_1303.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1303.jpg" alt="Turns 1-3" title="Turns 1-3"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">The Ringwraith had nearly cleared the treeline by turn three,
so Sam stopped to distract it by throwing a stone.  Unfortunately, he rolled a '1', and
even using his single Might point wasn't enough to force a "hit".  So the Ringwraith remained
undistracted for turn 4.

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 4</h3>

<p><a href="Images/thIMG_1309.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1309.jpg" alt="Turn 4 Overview" title="Turn 4 Overview"></a></p>

<p><a href="Images/thIMG_1314.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1314.jpg" alt="Turn 4 Closeup" title="Turn 4 Closeup"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Sam tried to throw another stone and succeeded.  Now he knows to aim
for the rocks and not the soft pine needles.  Meanwhile the other three hobbits take advantage
of the Ringwraith's preoccupation to hurry as far as they can to the ferry without being spotted.

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turns 5-6</h3>

<p><a href="Images/thIMG_1325.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1325.jpg" alt="Turns 5-6" title="Turns 5-6"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Sam risked one more turn of no movement to throw another rock, but then
got nervous about being left too far behind.  The Ringwraith was thus able to begin to move back
to the edge of the forest.

<p class="initialCap">The other hobbits swung south to remain unspotted.

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 7</h3>

<p><a href="Images/thIMG_1334.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1334.jpg" alt="Turn 7" title="Turn 7"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">With nowhere else to hide, the hobbits decided to dash for the ferry.
The Ringwraith now has them in his sights!

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 8</h3>

<p><a href="Images/thIMG_1337.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1337.jpg" alt="Turn 8 Overview" title="Turn 8 Overview"></a></p>

<p><a href="Images/thIMG_1340.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1340.jpg" alt="Turn 8: Frodo's eye view" title="Turn 8: Frodo's eye view"></a></p>

<p><a href="Images/thIMG_1343.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1343.jpg" alt="Turn 8: Combat closeup" title="Turn 8: Combat closeup"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Priority starts to matter now, and Evil wins.  The Ringwraith charges
towards the hobbits and succeeds in getting within magic range.  Last time I decided that I was
too stingy with the magic use, so this time I had the Ringwraith <em>Compel</em> Frodo with two
dice.  The roll was a '6' (the best result), and Frodo's hand slowly moved to the ring.  Frodo
decided to resist with only one Will point, and managed to roll the needed '6' without even using
his special hobbits-resist-magic rule.  With a start, Frodo jerks his hand away from the ring
and he, Merry, and Pippin, thumbing their noses at the Nazgul, run for the ferry.

<p class="initialCap">Left behind, Sam decides to charge the Ringwraith and easily passes his
courage check.  Good ol' Sam.  The goal was just to drain the Ringwraith of a Will point, but
despite the -1 unarmed penalty, Sam wins the combat and miraculously goes on to roll the 6,5 needed
to eliminate the Ringwraith!

<p class="initialCap">"Any more of them Black Riders that you need me to take care of before I
start fixin' dinner, Mr. Frodo?"  Well, this is why we game, isn't?  But I didn't go to all the
trouble of writing this stuff down and taking photographs just to have it all invalidated by wacky
luck.  So I decided to pretend that although Sam won the battle, he did not succeed in inflicting
a wound, and the game played on.

<p><br></p>

<h3>Turn 9</h3>

<p><a href="Images/thIMG_1346.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1346.jpg" alt="Turn 9 Overview" title="Turn 9 Overview"></a></p>

<p><a href="Images/thIMG_1347.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1347.jpg" alt="Turn 9 Closeup" title="Turn 9 Closeup"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good wins the important priority roll, and Sam decides to charge
the Ringwraith to ensure that the others make it to the ferry.  Sam passes his courage check
yet again, and though the Ringwraith wins the combat it fails to wound.  It's now down to 3 Will.

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 10</h3>

<p><a href="Images/thIMG_1349.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1349.jpg" alt="Turn 10" title="Turn 10"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good wins priority again, and Sam again charges.  He passes his courage
check and wins the combat but fails to wound.

<p class="initialCap">Frodo, Merry, and Pippin board the ferry and, somewhat meanly given
Sam's heroics, cast off without him.

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 11</h3>

<p><a href="Images/thIMG_1353.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1353.jpg" alt="Turn 11" title="Turn 11"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil finally wins priority, but with the other hobbits safe there's nothing
to do but charge Sam.  With the cavalry bonuses, the Ringwraith wins and inflicts a wound on
brave Sam.  Neither of Sam's Fate points avail him, so now the both sides are down to a single wound
remaining. The Ringwraith has but one Will left.

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 12 and End</h3>

<p><a href="Images/thIMG_1356.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1356.jpg" alt="Turn 12" title="Turn 12"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil wins priority, but Sam uses his Might to call a Heroic move and,
surprise!, charges the Ringwraith.  He again passes his courage test, and again wins the combat
(that's three of four times, despite the -1 modifier!).  Though he fails to inflict a wound,
the Ringwraith no longer has any Will points and dissolves with a menacing shriek.

<p class="initialCap">Sam bandages himself up.  "Coming, Mr. Frodo!"

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Post-game Thoughts</h3>

<p class="initialCap">I'm more convinced than ever that the lone Ringwraith has virtually
no chance to win this scenario (though a draw might be possible).  However, a bunch of Ringwraiths
might be interesting, so I'm curious to see how the Bree and Weathertop scenarios work out.
