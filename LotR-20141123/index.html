<h1>Brockenborings</h1>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<p class="initialCap">This is the third scenario in <i>The Scouring of
the Shire</i>.  Lobelia Sackville-Baggins and Fatty Bolger's meeting with
some local hobbits is broken up by Sharkey and a band of Ruffians.
Can four hobbits make it off the board before being collected for the
lockholes by the Evil force?</p>

<p class="initialCap">The two named hobbits count as <i>three</i> hobbits for
exiting purposes, so clearly much attention will be focused on them.</p>

<h3>The Forces</h3>
<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_0211.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/IMG_0211.JPG" alt="Good Force" title="Good Force"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_0210.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/IMG_0210.JPG" alt="Evil Force" title="Evil Force"></a>
</p>

<p class="initialCap">Fatty and Lobelia are supported by eight Hobbit Militia, so less than half the
good models need exit to win. If my Lobelia looks different from yours, that's because I'm unwilling
to pay the outrageous prices being charged for the model on eBay, so I made one of my own.  It doesn't
look anywhere near as good as the Perry boys' effort, but it sure was a lot cheaper.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Sharkey's band has faithful lackey Worm, 3 Ruffians with bows, and three
Ruffians with whips.  As they are outnumbered, they will need to make the most of their faster movement
and Sharkey's <i>Immobilize</i> spell.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h3>Setup</h3>

<a href="Images/IMG_0215.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/IMG_0215.JPG" alt="Sharkey & Worm" title="Sharkey & Worm"></a>
</p>

<p class="initialCap">A hobbit hole is set up in the center of the board, and the hobbits are all placed
touching it. Fatty is at the rear, Lobelia is at the front door, and the rest are more or less spaced
out evenly.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Evil men have to be placed at least 18" from any hobbit.  The eight men
set up two to a corner, with Sharkey and Worm in the southwest</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 1</h3>

<p><a href="Images/IMG_0218.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/IMG_0218.JPG" alt="Turn 1 Southwest" title="Turn 1 Southwest"></a></p>
<p><a href="Images/IMG_0219.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/IMG_0219.JPG" alt="Turn 1 Southeast" title="Turn 1 Southeast"></a></p>

<p><a href="Images/IMG_0221.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/IMG_0221.JPG" alt="Turn 1 Northwest" title="Turn 1 Northwest"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority</p>

<p class="initialCap">There's not much finesse this turn.  The hobbits run for the nearest edge, four heading
East and a pair each going North, West, and South.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The men can't be everywhere. So Sharkey decides to ignore the two hobbits
heading West, in hopes of bagging Lobelia, Fatty, and five other hobbits.  Two bowmen make only
a half move, hoping to shoot a hobbit right off the bat, but their arrows fail to wound.  The rest
of the men move to intercept the fleeing hobbits, with Sharkey himself going after Lobelia.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 2</h3>

<p><a href="Images/IMG_0222.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/IMG_0222.JPG" alt="Turn 2 South" title="Turn 2 South"></a></p>
<p><a href="Images/IMG_0223.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/IMG_0223.JPG" alt="Turn 2 East" title="Turn 2 East"></a></p>
<p><a href="Images/IMG_0224.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/IMG_0224.JPG" alt="Turn 2 Northwest" title="Turn 2 Northwest"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 5-4</p>

<p class="initialCap">Sharkey advances, Worm in tow, and casts <i>Immobilize</i> on Lobelia, whose innate hobbit
magic resistance fails to ward off the spell.  The same two bowmen that shot last turn (one in the northwest, one
in the southeast) take half moves so they can try again this turn.  The remaining men continue to rush toward the hobbits.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The hobbits, excepting of course the immobile Lobelia, run. I considered trying to throw
stones, but with only a 1 in 12 chance of a kill it seemed better to move than to shoot. A lesson perhaps I should
have learned with the Ruffians, for the two bowmen continue to be ineffective.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 3</h3>

<p><a href="Images/IMG_0227.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/IMG_0227.JPG" alt="Turn 3 Southeast" title="Turn 3 Southeast"></a></p>
<p><a href="Images/IMG_0228.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/IMG_0228.JPG" alt="Turn 3 East" title="Turn 3 East"></a></p>
<p><a href="Images/IMG_0229.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/IMG_0229.JPG" alt="Turn 3 North" title="Turn 3 North"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 5-4.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The hobbits continue to run.  Lobelia and the nearby Militia hobbit decide to split up and
change direction, Lobelia heading West while her compatriot ignores unchivalrously heads East.  On that side of the
table the four hobbits take advantage of the clump of woods, which blocks line of sight (and hence prevents charges).</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil continues to close in. No charges are possible, though there will clearly be some
hand to hand action next turn.  Ruffian bowmanship continues to disappoint (well, the Evil side, anyway) but
whip men in the East are close enough to attack, and the whips actually manage to kill a hobbit!</p>

<p class="initialCap">So first blood goes to Evil, 0-1.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 4</h3>

<p><a href="Images/IMG_0232.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/IMG_0232.JPG" alt="Turn 4 South" title="Turn 4 South"></a></p>
<p><a href="Images/IMG_0233.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/IMG_0233.JPG" alt="Turn 4 East" title="Turn 4 East"></a></p>
<p><a href="Images/IMG_0234.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/IMG_0234.JPG" alt="Turn 4 North" title="Turn 4 North"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 6-5.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Luck goes Sharkey's way, as the men rush most of the hobbits before they can move. The exceptions
are the two hobbits in the west (as always); the hobbit in the woods clump, who exits the other side, out of the line
of sight of the Ruffians; and Fatty's partner, who bravely rushes into his melee.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The whips all miss this turn, and though Worm is stabbing Lobelia in the back, he fails to
wound her (do corsets count as armor?). Though that's disappointing to Evil, things are worse in the North, where
Fatty manages to kill his Ruffian opponent! In the South and West, Evil manages to take down two hobbits in return.

<p class="initialCap">The honors are now 1-3 in Evil's favor.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 4</h3>

<p><a href="Images/IMG_0236.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/IMG_0236.JPG" alt="Turn 6 West" title="Turn 6 West"></a></p>
<p><a href="Images/IMG_0237.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/IMG_0237.JPG" alt="Turn 6 South" title="Turn 6 South"></a></p>
<p><a href="Images/IMG_0238.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/IMG_0238.JPG" alt="Turn 6 East" title="Turn 6 East"></a></p>
<p><a href="Images/IMG_0239.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/IMG_0239.JPG" alt="Turn 6 North" title="Turn 6 North"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 5-3.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The danger to Evil now is that Fatty and his friend will exit the board and win the game.
Sharkey and his bowman run north and the lone Ruffian near Fatty (a bowman) tries to get within melee range next turn.
Worm continues to try to stab Lobelia in the back, and in the east the three whipmen divide up, two taking on the
hobbit they can see and the third moving to intercept the guy that escaped through the woods.</p>

<p class="initialCap">In the west, the two hobbits we've been ignoring all game finally exit.  Good is halfway towards
winning now!  And Fatty and friend make it to the very edge of the board.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Lobelia survives yet another attack, but the hobbit being ganged up on by the two whipmen
goes down.  Evil is ahead 1-4.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 5</h3>

<p class="initialCap">Good wins the Priority Roll in the most dramatic way possible with a 4-4 tie, and Fatty
strolls leisurely off the board to win a victory for Good!</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Post-game Thoughts</h3>

<p class="initialCap">That seemed much more satisfying than Beating the Bounds. Though Good won reasonably
handily (effectively getting six models off the table with only four needed to win), I can see how Evil
could pull out a victory.  Had Evil's missile fire been at all effective, and/or Sharkey had moved to
a move centralized position (and hence maybe able to slow down Fatty), and/or Evil had diverted more
men to deal with Fatty, then the results here might have differed.</p>

<p class="initialCap">This scenario certainly seems worth giving another go sometime.</p>
