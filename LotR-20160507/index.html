<h1>Barrels Out of Bond</h1>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<p class="initialCap">This is a scenario of Games Workshop's <i>Hobbit Strategy
Battle Game</i>, from the <i>Desolation of Smaug</i> journeybook.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Here we see the Bilbo and his dwarf companions
escaping in barrels from the jails of the elven king.  In the book,
that's all there is, so book purists will want to try the scenario without
the Evil forces.  But the movie introduces a crowd of orcs under
Bolg trying to kill the dwarves, and a band of elves under Legolas and
Tauriel trying in turn to kill the orcs.  And that's what we're going
to try here.</p>

<h3>The Forces</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_0490.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0490.JPG" alt="The River Running" title="The River Running"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_0488.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0488.JPG" alt="The Dwarves & Bilbo" title="The Dwarves & Bilbo"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_0486.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0486.JPG" alt="The Elves" title="The Elves"></a>

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">The board is a little bigger than usual at 4' x 6'.  The water is deep, so the swimming rules get
a good workout in this scenario.  We're at the west edge of the board, where the barrels are going to start, facing
east.  If 9+ dwarves and Bilbo make it off the eastern edge, the Good side wins.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The dwarves and Bilbo are in their barrels. I love these models, even though they are really only
useable in this one scenario.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Mirkwood Rangers are led by Legolas (left) and Tauriel (right).  If using the Fellowship Legolas
model bothers you, warning: there's worse yet to come.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Warg Riders are lead by Bolg (front left) and Fimbul (front right).  The leader models are
official, though I've used my own color scheme for Fimbul.  The rest of the "Hunter Orcs on Fell Wargs" are really just
regular ol' <i>Two Towers</i>-era warg riders.  I've never used these guys in a game, so I can't justify buying
entirely new models.  The metal figures look better to my eyes, but the plastics are more practical, as by not gluing
the riders to the warg they can double as plain wargs as well.</p>

<p class="initialCap">My "Hunter Orcs" are likewise just a regular box of orcs, barring Narzug (in front) who is
again a regulation model in a custom painting scheme.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Setup</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_0491.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0491.JPG" alt="The Left Bank" title="The Left Bank"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_0494.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0494.JPG" alt="The Barrel Riders" title="The Barrel Riders"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_0495.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0495.JPG" alt="The Welcoming Committee" title="The Welcoming Committee"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_0493.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0493.JPG" alt="The Right Bank" title="The Right Bank"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">The dwarves begin in their barrels within 3" of the west edge.  They set up as far west as they can and towards
the left (north) bank a bit so as to give the rangers a chance to jump on in a move or two.  The rangers themselves will enter
on Turn 1.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil sets up anywhere at least 24" away from the dwarves.  Not having better ideas, I divided the foot troops
into three groups and placed one (led by Narzug) on the central island, one on the left bank, and one on the right.  The warg riders were likewise
split in half, Bolg leading the left and Fimbul the right.  Some troops were deployed a little farther back as a reserve, but the
bowmen were all placed to get into action as quickly as possible.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 1</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_0497.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0497.JPG" alt="The Left Bank" title="The Left Bank"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_0498.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0498.JPG" alt="The Barrel Riders" title="The Barrel Riders"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_0499.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0499.JPG" alt="The Right Bank" title="The Right Bank"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">As always, Good starts a scenario with Priority.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The rangers enter from the bottom (west) edge, 8 on the right bank and 12, along with Legolas and Tauriel,
on the left.  Four of the rangers make a full move hoping to be in position to jump on barrel next turn.  The rest make only a
half move so that they can fire their bows.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The barrel movement is randomized and so the beginning tight-knit formation spreads out a bit.  A couple dwarves contemplate
taking the southern route, but the island placement makes this seem difficult.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The evil archers move half where needed to get within range.  The hand weapon warg riders rush the rangers.
The reserves move to occupy the eastern islands (off in the distance) and one orc drowns (just visible in the middle image).</p>

<p class="initialCap">In Shooting, the Good site kills Fimbul's warg, an orc bowman, and puts 2 wounds on Bolg!  A point of Fate
negates one of the latter.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil's return fire is ineffective until the very last shot, which takes out a ranger.<p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 2</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_0501.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0501.JPG" alt="The Left Bank" title="The Left Bank"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_0502.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0502.JPG" alt="The Barrel Riders" title="The Barrel Riders"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_0503.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0503.JPG" alt="The Right Bank" title="The Right Bank"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 2-2.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Evil archers mostly hold to maximize their chances of a hit.  The melee figures charge.  Two orcs
drown swimming.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Three rangers jump on the barrels to protect Bilbo and two of the dwarves.  The rest of the good force
stays put to avoid the movement penalty when shooting, too.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil's shooting is a bit improved over last turn, as Narzug puts a hit on Dwalin's barrel and an orc
archer does the same for Thorin.  In return, a ranger kills a warg rider, Legolas puts a 2nd hit on Bolg, and then Tauriel
delivers the <i>coup de gr&acirc;ce</i> on the leader.  Bolg's warg gets 6,6 on his Courage check and sticks around for some revenge.</p>

<p class="initialCap">An ominous start for Evil...</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 3</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_0505.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0505.JPG" alt="The Left Bank" title="The Left Bank"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_0506.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0506.JPG" alt="The Barrel Riders" title="The Barrel Riders"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_0508.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0508.JPG" alt="The Barrel Riders, Closeup" title="The Barrel Riders, Closeup"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_0507.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0507.JPG" alt="The Right Bank" title="The Right Bank"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 6-2.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Tauriel calls a Heroic Move to avoid being charged by the wargs.  A few brave rangers "volunteer" to face the wargs
while the rest of the rangers, Legolas, and Tauriel inch forward to better their range on the orcs near the barrels.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Evil bowmen hold their positions again to maximize the effectiveness of their bows, while the
rest of the orcs move to engage.  Luck is not with the swimmers and four of them drown.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Alas, Evil shooting is completely ineffective.  Good has more luck, scoring two hits on Narzug (one negated by Fate)
and killing a warg and a bowman.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The orcs fare better in the combat phase, winning all the melees and taking down two of the Rangers.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 4</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_0513.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0513.JPG" alt="The Left Bank" title="The Left Bank"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_0514.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0514.JPG" alt="The Barrel Riders" title="The Barrel Riders"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_0512.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0512.JPG" alt="The Right Bank" title="The Right Bank"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 2-1.</p>

<p class="initialCap">On the left bank, the rangers swarm the wargs so that Legolas and Tauriel can concentrate on taking down the threats
to the barrels. On the right bank, the rangers hold and accept the charge of the wargs.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The barrels are almost at the halfway point on the river and three orcs are close enough to jump on, with two others
close enough to attack.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Elvish archery is feeble, with only Tauriel managing to hit; she kills two orcs.  Evil responds by putting a hit on
Balin's barrel.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The dwarves make up for the lack of shooting results by killing three of the attacking orcs.  Only Ori loses his fight,
but he is lucky enough to avoid any wounds.  The rangers kill a warg and two warg riders, one of the striken riders' warg deciding to stick around.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Another frustrating turn for Evil.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 5</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_0516.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0516.JPG" alt="The Left Bank" title="The Left Bank"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_0517.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0517.JPG" alt="The Barrel Riders" title="The Barrel Riders"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_0518.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0518.JPG" alt="The Right Bank" title="The Right Bank"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 3-1*.</p>

<p class="initialCap">There's an asterisk on the Priority results because Balin spends 1 Will point to reroll Priority, and gets a 4, steal
Priority for Good. In response, Fimbul calls a Heroic Move, and decides to take the warg riders on the right bank east. After all, the
rangers are irrelevant to winning the scenario.  Another unlucky Orc drowns.</p>

<p class="initialCap">On the left bank, the rangers swarm the wargs again -- surely they will win a combat eventually! -- while
Legolas and Tauriel remain free to shoot their bows.  The barrels continue their drift down the river and pick up a few more
unwelcome passengers.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Good shooting is tragically poor, killing only Fimbul's warg and one of the orcs on a barrel.  (In retrospect,
it's not clear whether a barrel-riding orc is a legal shooting target or not.)</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil shooting, such of it is, sees Narzug putting a wound on Balin.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Combat again favors Evil, as an orc puts a wound on Bifur (which is a bit of a mixed blessing as it activates his
<i>Battle Damaged</i> special rule) and the wargs continue to win their fights and kill another ranger.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 6</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_0520.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0520.JPG" alt="The Left Bank" title="The Left Bank"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_0521.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0521.JPG" alt="The Barrel Riders" title="The Barrel Riders"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_0522.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0522.JPG" alt="The Right Bank" title="The Right Bank"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 5-3.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The rangers on the left bank tackle the wargs again.  You have to admire their persistence, if
not their intelligence.  On the right bank, the rangers half-move as their bows will still be able to reach targets
even after the Evil move.  They'll never catch the orcs, so archery is about all they can contribute at this point.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The orcs on the right bank run as fast as they can, hoping to catch up to any stragglers in
the barrels.   There's only one free Evil model on the left bank -- a warg rider bowman -- and he runs to hide behind
a tree, where he can take potshots at the barrels next turn.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The warg riders hanging out on the far islands swim towards the nearing barrels.  With a dieroll
of 6 one warg rider leaps from his Warg to stand atop Dwalin's barrel!</p>

<p class="initialCap">In the Shooting phase, Legolas kills Narzug at last, and rangers take out another orc bowman,
the orc on Bifur's barrel, and put a hit on Fimbul.  No Evil shooting is possible this turn -- every bowman either moved,
is out of range, or is dead.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The wargs continue to win in combat.  The trapped warg's sad roll of 2 still manages to beat the Elves' 1-1-1,
and the warg kills a ranger.  The rangers on the other warg do better with 5-4, but the warg gets the 6
and he, too, kills a ranger.</p>

<p class="initialCap">If only the orcs attacking the barrels were as lucky!  Well, they are in a way, because both Fili
and Dwalin win their fight but neither can score higher than a 2 on their rolls to wound, so their attacking orcs live to fight
another day.  Or turn, at least.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 7</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_0524.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0524.JPG" alt="The Left Bank" title="The Left Bank"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_0525.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0525.JPG" alt="The Barrel Riders" title="The Barrel Riders"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_0526.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0526.JPG" alt="The Right Bank" title="The Right Bank"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 3-2.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Balin tries to steal Priority again using another Will point, but he fails with a 1.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The wargs charge everywhere, though still too far away to engage on the right bank, where Fimbul
calls a Heroic March to try to get back into the game.  Three orcs climb aboard the barrels.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The elves on the left bank move to attack the wargs, even Legolas joining in because clearly
the rangers on their own aren't cutting the mustard.  Tauriel remains unengaged for some long range sniping.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Tauriel manages a deadeye shot on the warg in the river.  Everyone else whiffs.</p>

<p class="initialCap">In combat, an orc attacks Kili and manages to get the 6, but so does Kili and this time
he succeeds in killing his foe.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Thorin has a little harder time, getting 5 against an Evil 6, but a Might point solves that
problem and he manages to kill both the orc and the warg attacking him.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Dwalin and his foe only get 4 highest, so Dwalin wins on Fight value and he, too, kills his orc.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The wargs finally succumb to numbers.  They sure punched above their weight class, though.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 8</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_0529.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0529.JPG" alt="The Barrel Riders" title="The Barrel Riders"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_0530.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0530.JPG" alt="The Right Bank" title="The Right Bank"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good priority, 3-1</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil's clearly lost at this point, but I played one more turn anyway because it was fun.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Fimbul uses his last Might point to call another Heroic March, but elvish archery takes out
the only warg rider really capable of catching the barrels and I decided to call it as a decisive victory for Good.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Post-game Thoughts</h3>

<p class="initialCap">That wasn't particularly close, was it?  As a game, I mean; it actually <i>was</i> pretty close
to the movie result.</p>

<p class="initialCap">I think having the wargs get caught up in attacking the elves, and vice versa,
was a mistake.  The dwarves are really the only figures that matter.  So I really misused Bolg and Fimbul
going after the rangers.</p>

<p class="initialCap">And the orcs attacking the barrels could have really used help from those heroes.
The dwarves have better Fight values, Might points to modify die rolls, and the Wounds and Fate to survive a
couple of rounds.  All of which makes it hard for even Hunter Orcs to win combats against the dwarves and take
advantage of the dwarves being trapped within their barrels.</p>

<p class="initialCap">I think it's worth considering making the dwarves unarmed in this scenario.  Maybe say they
are unarmed until they kill an enemy, in which case they can arm themselves, which is true to the movie albeit
requires a bit more record-keeping.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The barrels move surprisingly quickly.  At d6+3" per turn, they are
on average faster than orcs (6"), much less dwarves on land (5").  The wargs can outrun them but Evil's
foot models pretty much get one shot at the barrels before they fly away.  So setting up some reserves was
a good idea, even if a lot of them drowned trying to get out to the islands.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The map configuration has some pretty big effects on play.  I hadn't realized until about
halfway through the scenario that the Dwarves had almost a straight shot down the river, with little need to
manuever.  I'd move the islands next outing to force more lateral movement.</p>

<p class="initialCap">This scenario isn't suited for truly competitive play because the rules for how the barrels
work seem under-specified.  Here's a sampling of the situations that you have to work out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do bowmen atop a moving barrel count as having moved when shooting?  I ruled "no".</li>
  <li>If two barrels are adjacent, can they both fight against a barrel-rider atop one of them?  Or does the rider
  attack only the Dwarf within the barrel being ridden?  I played that adjacent dwarves can participate, but it's probably
  fairer to the Evil side to say they can't.</li>
  <li>Are Evil models riding on barrels legal targets for Good shooting?  I ruled that they were, based on the fact
  that the barrels aren't counted as in the way.  It seems true to the movie this way, too.  But it seems a little counter
  to the spirit of the rules.</li>
  <li>Do the control zones of swimming Evil models block the movement of the barrels?  In one turn,
  a warg with Priority charged a barrel, and by the rules as written that barrel would have stayed still while all
  the other dwarves flew by normally during their movement.  That didn't sit well with me, so I ruled that the barrel
  still moved, but the warg moved with it, and so there was still combat at the end of the turn.  I'd say during movement the barrels
  should be able to go through enemy models (as if they were flying), but when they do so the enemy can make a jump
  test to climb aboard.</li>
</ul>

<p class="initialCap">All in all, though, a thematic scenario with some unusual game mechanics that was a lot of fun to play.</p>
