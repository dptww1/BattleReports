<h1>The Last March of the Ents</h1>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<p class="initialCap">This <i>Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game</i> scenario is
from the Two Towers Journeybook.  Treebeard and three Ents attack Isengard to put a
stop to Saruman's nefarious machinations.</p>

<h3>The Forces</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/img002.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img002.jpg" alt="Evil Uruks" title="Evil Uruks"></a>
<a href="Images/img003.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img003.jpg" alt="Evil Orcs" title="Evil Orcs"></a>
<a href="Images/img004.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img004.jpg" alt="The Ents" title="The Ents"></a>
<a href="Images/img005.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img005.jpg" alt="Isengard" title="Isengard"></a>
</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Evil forces have both Uruk-hai and regular Orc contingents <i>(Pictures 1 and 2)</i>.
If you look closely near the bannermen you can see that each contingent has a model with golden triangles
painted on the base; those mark a Captain.  The scenario as written lists an Isengard Troll and
Feral Uruk-hai among the Evil troops, but I'm not a fan of Games Workshop's made-up stuff so I substituted
an equal points values worth of various types of warriors.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Evil force is effectively almost twice as large as seen here, because each
warrior that is killed has a 50% of re-entering the game as a reinforcement.  The scenario doesn't
specify where they should appear, so I ruled that they could appear at any scaffold.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Good forces are <i>(Picture 3, left to right)</i> a Linden Ent, a Generic Ent,
a Birch Ent, and Treebeard.  Merry and Pippin are riding Treebeard and will contribute some low-quality
shooting during the game.  The Linden and Birch Ents are lovely, characterful models from
<a href="http://www.shadowandflame.co.uk/">Shadow and Flame</a>.  Unfortunately, at the time of this
writing they appear to be out of stock.  The Generic Ent -- let's call him Quickbeam -- is Games Workshop's
plastic model kit and looks positively cartoony in comparison.  Treebeard is a fine effort, though; my only
complaint is that he looks a bit short compared to the others.
</p>

<p class="initialCap">The board <i>(Picture 4)</i> has three scaffold's supporting Saruman's
manufacturing operations on a 2' x 4' board.  If the Ents can destroy all three without losing Treebeard,
they win.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h3>Setup</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/img006.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img006.jpg" alt="Good Setup" title="Good Setup"></a>
<a href="Images/img007.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img007.jpg" alt="Evil Setup" title="Evil Setup"></a>
<a href="Images/img008.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img008.jpg" alt="Evil Setup #2" title="Evil Setup #2"></a>
</p>

<p class="initialCap">My table is actually a little smaller than 4', so the Ents are going to start closer
than they should be to the scaffolds.  To make up for that discrepancy, I set them up as far from the closest
scaffold as I could get.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Since Evil is supposed to set up in three groups around the scaffolding, I divided
each troop type into three and randomly rolled for the location of the remainder.  I then put the Orcs
on the scaffolding to represent the workers, then distributed the Uruks around the scaffolding
to act as guards.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 1</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/img009.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img009.jpg" alt="Turn 1" title="Turn 1"></a>
</p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority</p>

<p class="initialCap">As always, Good starts a scenario with Priority.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Ents advance but stay out of immediate charge range next turn.  Evil bowmen
stay put so that they can shoot, while the other troops move towards the Ents.  Orcs near the stairs
use them so as to descend safely, but Orcs that are too far from the stairs jump down.  That mostly
works to Evil's advantage, but two unfortunates muff their Jump rolls and then die from the falling
damage.  You can see them to the right of the nearest scaffold, just behind the crevice.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil begins the game with a lucky Wound from a crossbow on Treebeard.  He expends
2 Fate points to negate it.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 2</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/img010.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img010.jpg" alt="Turn 2 Movement" title="Turn 2 Movement"></a>
<a href="Images/img011.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img011.jpg" alt="Birch Ent" title="Birch Ent"></a>
<a href="Images/img012.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img012.jpg" alt="Quickbeam" title="Quickbeam"></a>
<a href="Images/img013.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img013.jpg" alt="Treebeard" title="Treebeard"></a>
<a href="Images/img014.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img014.jpg" alt="Linden Ent" title="Linden Ent"></a>
</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 6-5</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil charges where he can <i>(Picture 1)</i>.  There are not many models in range,
but there are enough to prevent the Ents from making forward progress.  Only one potential charger finds
the Ents terrifying enough to fail his Courage test.  One of the two dead models from last turn reappears.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Shooting sees only one casualty, the Uruk-hai facing the Birch Ent <i>(Picture 2)</i>
In some ways, this is actually a good thing for Evil, as it denies the Good player a chance to use
any of the Ents' Brutal Power attacks, which, as we are about to see, can be an effective force
multiplier.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Quickbeam wins his combat and decides to use the "Hurl" Brutal Power attack
again his opponent <i>(Picture 3)</i>.  He rolls high, knocks over two other enemies and kills the Berserker
in the process.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Treebeard likewise wins and likewise Hurls, taking out two warriors and knocking down
a few others <i>(Picture 4)</i>.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Linden Ent also wins and Hurls, throwing his opponent through the Uruk Hai
Captain but failing to inflict any wounds <i>(Picture 5)</i>.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 3</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/img015.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img015.jpg" alt="Beginning Combat" title="Beginning Combat"></a>
<a href="Images/img016.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img016.jpg" alt="Quickbeam's Barge" title="Quickbeam's Barge"></a>
<a href="Images/img017.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img017.jpg" alt="Quickbeam's Barge End" title="Quickbeam's Barge End"></a>
<a href="Images/img018.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img018.jpg" alt="Treebeard's Hurl" title="Treebeard's Hurl"></a>
<a href="Images/img019.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img019.jpg" alt="Linden Ent's Hurl" title="Linden Ent's Hurl"></a>
<a href="Images/img020.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img020.jpg" alt="Defiant Uruk-hai Captain" title="Defiant Uruk-hai Captain"></a>
</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 6-3.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Charges where he can and moves up to the battle line where he can't.  The prone
Uruk-hai Captain would like to charge the Linden Ent, but muffs his Courage roll and must stay put. The
Orc Captain likewise fails his Courage test, and the higher ranks wait to see what their underlings
can accomplish on their own <i>(Picture 1)</i>.  None of the four dead warriors from last turn return to play.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Shooting sees Evil scoring another wound, but this time the victim is the Birch Ent.
One wound down, eleven to go....</p>

<p class="initialCap">Quickbeam wins his combat <i>(Picture 2)</i> and then Barges.  He gets a good roll
and is able to engage two Uruks, including a crossbowman.  He wins, kills them both, and has cleared out
the Ents' left flank <i>(Picture 3)</i>.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Treebeard wins his combat, too, despite rolling a lousy 4 highest.  He hurls the
Berserker 9" and kills a couple of passed-through models <i>(Picture 4)</i>. Though the Berserker survives,
he's going to be out of combat range for a couple of turns.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Linden Ent also wins and also hurls, but the rolls a disappointing 1 for
the distance and the only damage done is to a couple of Evil models' pride <i>(Picture 5)</i>.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil's luck continues to improve, as though the Birch Ent beats his Orc attacker,
and, sensing an opportunity, arges into the prone Uruk-hai Captain.  But he rolls just 1,2,3 on his combat
dice; the prone Captain answers with an even worse 1 &amp; 2, but, fearing the consequences of defeat,
he expends his two Might points to win the battle.  Though he gets no strikes, he stands up and shouts his
defiance at his enemy.
<i>(Picture 6)</i>.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 4</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/img022.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img022.jpg" alt="Before Combat" title="Before Combat"></a>
<a href="Images/img021.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img021.jpg" alt="Quickbeam Flanks" title="Quickbeam Flanks"></a>
<a href="Images/img023.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img023.jpg" alt="Treebeard's Hurl" title="Treebeard's Hurl"></a>
</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 2-1.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil charges again <i>(Picture 1).</i> It's pretty obvious strategy: if the Ents can't move,
they can't attack the scaffolds, and eventually they will lose combats and take wounds, while any dead Evil
warriors combat back 50% of the time. This turn they do even better and two of the three dead from last turn
reappear.  There are now 6 warriors in Evil's permanently dead pile.</p>

<p class="initialCap">On the Ents' left, the unengaged Quickbeam must decide whether to move to
help his compatriots or to take advantage of relative absence of Evil forces to get closer to the scaffolding.
The latter seems to make more sense and off the hasty Ent goes <i>(Picture 2)</i>.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Shooting is completely ineffective this turn.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Treebeard wins his combat and has a particularly effective Hurl, killing a bunch
(prone models pointing left) and knocking over others (prone models pointing right) <i>(Picture 3)</i>.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Linden and Birch Ents lose their combats, however (6-5 and 5-4, so close...) and each
takes a wound.  The Birch Ent now has only one wound remaining!</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 5</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/img024.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img024.jpg" alt="Before Combat" title="Before Combat"></a>
<a href="Images/img025.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img025.jpg" alt="Quickbeam Before Combat" title="Quickbeam Before Combat"></a>
<a href="Images/img026.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img026.jpg" alt="Quickbeam After Combat" title="Quickbeam After Combat"></a>
</p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 5-5.</p>

<p class="initialCap">It's now the Ents' turn to charge and try to make some progress towards the
scaffolds.  Evil then piles in where he can and continues to bring up troops from the far scaffold
<i>(Picture 1)</i>.
Two of last turn's casualties return; there are now 8 permanently dead Evil models.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Shooting sees the Birch Ent taking another Orc arrow, making three wounds
and a dead Ent.  Bad news for the Good player!</p>

<p class="initialCap">Quickbeam is surrounded <i>(Picture 2)</i> but luckily wins his combat 6-5.
While killing Orcs is always fun, the scaffolds are the true goal and so he aims his strikes there.
His three attacks are doubled by special rule against the scaffolds, and
he rolls an awesome 2,5,6,6,6,6 to land five hits of the six needed to destroy it.
<i>(Picture 3, black poker chips marking the damage)</i>.

<p class="initialCap">On the other side of the board, Treebeard wins his combat and outright kills
two enemies, while the Linden Ent loses and takes another wound, now having just one remaining.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 6</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/img027.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img027.jpg" alt="Before Combat I" title="Before Combat I"></a>
<a href="Images/img029.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img029.jpg" alt="Before Combat II" title="Before Combat II"></a>
<a href="Images/img028.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img028.jpg" alt="Quickbeam's Carnage" title="Quickbeam's Carnage"></a>
<a href="Images/img030.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img030.jpg" alt="After Combat" title="After Combat"></a>
</p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 4-2.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Liking the taste of scaffold, Quickbeam moves in contact with it while
simultaneously pinning a crossbowman <i>(Picture 1)</i>.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Treebeard and the Linden Ent move to engage the closest Uruks while
covering each other's flank <i>(Picture 2)</i>.  Evil charges, a detachment in the rear heading towards
the rampaging Quickbeam and both warriors killed last turn reappearing.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Shooting is ineffective this turn.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Quickbeam easily wins his combat.  He uses one strike against the scaffold
and down it goes <i>(Picture 3)</i>!  An Orc underneath the structure and the two bowmen on top of
it are killed in the collapse.  Quickbeam's other strikes take out the crossbowman.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Against the Linden Ent, Evil rolls a 4 highest but the Orc Captain is in this
fight and he still has two Might points.  The Ent gets the 6, though, so there's little point in
expending the Might yet, and he Hurls the Captain 8", taking out an Uruk and an Orc and putting
two wounds on the Captain, who is kept alive only by his Fate point.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil rolls a 5 highest against Treebeard, who underperforms, getting only
a 4 highest.  So he expends his first Might point to cause a tied roll, because he wins on
higher Fight value.  He, too, hurls the Uruk Captain 8", but he kills just a single model.</p>

<p class="initialCap">All in all a pretty satisfying turn for Good. Seven Evil models were
killed this turn, the Captains are hurting, and one of the three scaffolds is down.  Still,
it's a loooong way to the other two scaffolds.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 7</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/img031.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img031.jpg" alt="Before Combat" title="Before Combat"></a>
<a href="Images/img032.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img032.jpg" alt="After Combat I" title="After Combat I"></a>
<a href="Images/img033.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img033.jpg" alt="After Combat II" title="After Combat II"></a>
</p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 6-2.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Quickbeam considers moving backward to get Hurling ammunition, but remembers
that the scaffolds are the goal. So instead he advances, moving past the rubble and out of charge
range of his former attackers.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Treebeard and the Linden Ent, fearful of being surrounded, back up a bit to
engage the models on their flanks.  Good is hoping for lots of failed Courage tests, and many
do fail, particularly against Quickbeam <i>(Picture 1)</i>.  Four of the seven models eliminated
last turn reappear.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Shooting takes out one of Quickbeam's attackers. The honors are about even here,
with the shooters inflicting wounds on both sides about equally.  But there are always more Evil troops,
whereas the Good models, down 25% with the loss of the Birch Ent, are looking thin on the ground.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Quickbeam wins his combat and debates whether to Hurl or Barge. He ends up
Hurling, hoping for casualties, but though he kills the thrown model, neither of the two models
knocked prone are wounded <i>(Picture 2)</i>.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Linden Ent wins and Hurls, too, trying to hit the Orc Captain but his Hurl
roll is a miserable 1, and the resulting 5" distance isn't enough, though the hurlee is killed.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Treebeard faces an Evil 6 highest but comes through himself with a 6 to win.
He also elects to Hurl, also rolls a 1, though he's closer to the Captain and just manages to hit him.
But again only the "projectile" is killed <i>(Picture 3)</i>.</p>

<p class="initialCap">There are now eleven models in Evil's dead pile.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 8</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/img034.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img034.jpg" alt="Before Combat I" title="Before Combat I"></a>
<a href="Images/img035.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img035.jpg" alt="Before Combat II" title="Before Combat II"></a>
</p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 4-2.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Quickbeam moves to attack the prone bannerman.  Treebeard and the Linden Ent consolidate.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil charges, with almost all Courage tests passing and all four dead models from last turn
reappearing.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Merry and Pippin have been plinking away without effect this entire game, but at least
Pippin lands a hit and kills an Orc. The crossbowmen decide to join in the fun of shooting Evil models and
take out two of Quickbeam's attackers. Oops!</p>

<p class="initialCap">Quickbeam ends up facing just one Orc, but that Orc gets a 6 and Quickbeam can manage only a
5.  Quickbeam's hide proves too tough for his enemy <i>(Picture 1)</i>.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Linden Ent is a repeat of Quickbeam, Good's high 5 losing to a 6 but no wounding.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Treebeard likewise faces a 6, but manages to roll a 6 himself and wins on Fight value.
He barges left and flattens a Berserker on his flank.</p>

<p class="initialCap">There were only 4 Evil models killed this turn, and two were own goals by the Evil side.
Not a great turn for the Ents.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 9</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/img036.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img036.jpg" alt="Before Combat I" title="Before Combat I"></a>
<a href="Images/img037.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img037.jpg" alt="Before Combat II" title="Before Combat II"></a>
<a href="Images/img038.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img038.jpg" alt="After Combat" title="After Combat"></a>
</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 4-2.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil charges, but has a tragic number of Courage Test failures.  Only one warrior manages
to get to Treebeard.  That's a brave Uruk-hai!  Three of four eligible dead warriors come back.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Merry evens the Shooting tally by downing an Orc.  The Evil crossbowmen are particularly
lethal this turn, wounding Quickbeam but at the cost of two warriors attacking him and also wounding
the Uruk-hai Captain.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Quickbeam loses his combat (only a 4 highest) on takes another wound <i>(Picture 1)</i>.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Treebeard loses his combat 5-6, but he's got a Might point to spend to claim the victory
anyway.  He Hurls his brave opponent 8" away and kills three models in doing so.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Linden Ent also loses his combat 5-6, but with no Might he must endure the strikes.
An Orc swordsman gets the lucky 6/4 combo and down the Linden Ent goes <i>(Picture 3)</i>!</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil lost six models this turn, but that doesn't compensate for the loss of an Ent.
The two remaining scaffolds are still as far away as ever.</p>

<p><br></p>
<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 10</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/img039.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img039.jpg" alt="Before Combat I" title="Before Combat I"></a>
<a href="Images/img040.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img040.jpg" alt="Before Combat II" title="Before Combat II"></a>
<a href="Images/img041.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img041.jpg" alt="After Combat I" title="After Combat I"></a>
<a href="Images/img042.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img042.jpg" alt="After Combat II" title="After Combat II"></a>
</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 4-2.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil charges again.  Three dead models are revived.  Shooting is ineffective
except for an Orc bow taking out the guy trapping Treebeard <i>(Picture 2)</i>.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Quickbeam's attackers get their 6 but so does Quickbeam, who uses his victory
to Barge up to the Uruk-hai Captain and subsequently kill him <i>(Picture 3)</i>.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Despite the impressive number of dice rolled against Treebeard, Evil gets only a
5 highest and Treebeard matches that.  The Orc Captain uses a Might point, and Treebeard matches it
to keep the win.  Treebeard's strikes are lethal, taking out the Orc Captain and two other warriors
<i>(Picture 4)</i>.  There is now no Might left in the game.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 11</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/img043.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img043.jpg" alt="Turn 11" title="Turn 11"></a>
</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 3-1.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil charges, but in the case of Quickbeam it doesn't matter because the crossbows
put him away permanently.  Treebeard gets his six in combat and decides to Barge -- hey, it would be
nice to get at least one hit against the second scaffold -- but his movement roll is a disappointing
1", not even enough to re-engage his tormentors.</p>

<p><br></p>
<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 12</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/img044.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img044.jpg" alt="Turn 12" title="Turn 12"></a>
</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 6-5.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil charges.  Pippin kills an Orc and the crossbows claim another, but they
also put a wound on Treebeard, whose last Fate point fails to negate it.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Treebeard flubs his combat roll with only a 4 highest, but Evil does no better.
Both sides must be getting pretty tired at this point.  Still, Treebeard does manage to kill
two of his opponents.</p>

<p><br></p>
<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 13</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/img045.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img045.jpg" alt="Good Setup" title="Good Setup"></a>
<a href="Images/img046.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img046.jpg" alt="Good Setup" title="Good Setup"></a>
</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 5-2.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil charges, not without a great many failed Courage tests. But Evil's luck
returns in the Shooting phase and Treebeard takes another wound.  He's got only one remaining!</p>

<p class="initialCap">The combat dice are tied at 5, so Treebeard wins.  He decides to Barge,
and finally gets a 6 and so can move a significant distance.  He engages an Orc with a two-handed
weapon and a Berserker, who also has a two-handed weapon.  Since two-handed weapons force a -1
on the fight die, this seems like a pretty good bet, but Treebeard manages only a 3 highest and
the Evil models get a 5.  They roll for Wounds, the Berserker gets a 6, and Treebeard goes down.
Game over!</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Post-game Thoughts</h3>

<p class="initialCap">That didn't seem very balanced, but it was a lot of fun.  The two sides
play very differently, with plenty of opportunity for those oh-so-fun Brutal Power attacks,
and it looks really cool.</p>

<p class="initialCap">I won't claim my Ent tactics were optimal. I think I'll rely on
Barging more often in the future in hopes of being able to keep moving forward, and it may
be worth sitting still for the first couple turns and just throwing rocks at the structures.
But despite suboptimal tactics, I think Good has a real uphill battle here.</p>

<p class="initialCap">What's really perplexing is that this scenario came out well
before the Brutal Power attacks in the Hobbit rulebook.  When Evil could just throw in a
single warrior to stop an Ent cold every turn, how would the Ents make any progress at all?</p>

<p class="initialCap">This scenario certainly seems worth giving another go sometime.  I am
mulling over some modifications, though:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Modify or even ignore the <b>Orcs of Isengard</b> rule which lets Evil models
  come back 50% of the time.  It just doesn't seem needed for playbalance purposes.</li>
  <li>If Evil warriors do come back, maybe they have to enter from the far edge instead
  of the scaffold of Evil's choice.</li>
  <li>Modify the force composition for fewer Uruk-hai, especially crossbows. Speaking
  "historically", Saruman emptied Isengard in his zeal to destroy Rohan.  There should
  be only dregs remaining, not his elite troops.</li>
  <li>Maybe destroying two scaffolds should be a Good victory?</li>
</ul>

<p class="initialCap">Thoughts?</p>
