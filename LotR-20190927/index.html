<h1>Maggot's Farm</h1>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<p class="initialCap">This is a scenario of Games Workshop's <i>Middle
Earth Strategy Battle Game</i>, the third in the 2019 edition of
<i>Scouring of the Shire</i>.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Based on my <a href="../LotR-20190922/">previous report</a> you might expect me to tackle the book's
<i>second</i> scenario , not the third.  But that scenario requires Lotho Sackville-Baggins, and GW hasn't released that
model yet.  Sure, I could use a substitute, but I figure I might as well tackle the scenarios that I do have models for --
and there are plenty of them -- and then I can always come back to rest when the models are out.  I'm not playing them
in campaign mode, anyway.</p>

<p class="initialCap">This scenario is a reworking of a scenario from the 2004 version of the <i>Scouring of the Shire</i>,
which I've reported a <a href="../LotR-20070619/">couple</a> of <a href="../LotR-20141115/">times</a> before.  Some of the
special rules were kept; Maggot's dogs begin in sentry mode, cause Terror, and Maggot himself won't enter until the alarm is raised, and
only then on a 5+.  And the recent rains affect the Ruffian's bows and so they hit only on 6+ rather than the usual 5+.</p>

<p class="initialCap">But there are couple of tweaks also.  Evil now gets an extra Ruffian, which is a nice boost given that
the victory conditions involve exiting the board, and there are more bows.  But Good's also been helped; Exiting
three Ruffians is a draw (not an Evil win), and Maggot is much more formidable in this edition
of the game, now having Strength 3 and Attacks 2 (vs 2 and 1).</p>

<p class="initialCap">This edition also updates the Sentry rule.  Sentry movement is no longer tied at all
to Priority, and the amount of movement on non-extreme results has been averaged out.  It's not clear which side this helps.</p>

<h3>The Forces</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_1301.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1301.JPG" alt="The Forces" title="The Forces" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">The Good forces are Farmer Maggot with his three dogs (from left to right) Grip, Wolf, and Fang.  The Ruffians
have three bowmen, one whipman, and two regular ol' thugs.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Setup</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_1302.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1302.JPG" alt="Setup" title="Setup" width="250" height="188"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_1303.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1303.JPG" alt="Setup, Closeup" title="Setup, Closeup" width="250" height="188"></a>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Only the dogs begin on the board, within 6&quot; of the scarecrow.  The Ruffians will enter from the east edge (the
far edge in the image).</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 1</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_1305.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1305.JPG" alt="Turn 1, Good" title="Turn 1, Good" width="250" height="188"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_1306.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1306.JPG" alt="Turn 1, Evil" title="Turn 1, Evil" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good always begins narrative scenarios with Priority.  But since the dogs are sentries, they can't move where
they wish.  Well, Wolf can, as his sentry roll is '6'. So he dashes into the woods.  Grip stays put, while Fang, controlled by the
Evil player, wanders away.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Ruffians enter from the eastern edge, the three bowmen in the north and the three others to the south.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 2</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_1311.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1311.JPG" alt="Turn 2, Backfield" title="Turn 2, Backfield" width="250" height="188"></a>

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 4-1.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Fang wanders again, and Wolf can again move freely and so continues his dash towards the Ruffians in hopes of
raising the alarm early.  Grip stirs himself and moves 3&quot; towards the woods.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Ruffians break into two groups, the archers moving northwest (2nd image, where you can barely see Wolf on the left)
and the other making their way along the south edge of the board (3rd image, also having fuzzy Wolf in the background).</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 3</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_1313.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1313.JPG" alt="Turn 3, Backfield" title="Turn 3, Backfield" width="250" height="188"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_1315.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1315.JPG" alt="Turn 3, North" title="Turn 3, North" width="250" height="188"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_1314.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1314.JPG" alt="Turn 3, South" title="Turn 3, South" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 6-1.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Good thinks this is another one of those situations where one would rather <i>not</i> have Priority, as it would
be advantageous to seeing where the Evil models go so as to have a better chance of raising the alarm.  Too bad.</p>

<p class="initialCap">This time Fang gets a normal move, while Wolf and Grip stay put.  This allows the Ruffians to continue their advance.</p>

<p class="initialCap">All three dogs are visible in the last image, but you have to look closely!</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 4</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_1318.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1318.JPG" alt="Turn 4, North" title="Turn 4, North" width="250" height="188"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_1317.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1317.JPG" alt="Turn 4, South" title="Turn 4, South" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 5-4.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The sentry dice heavily favor Good, with both Fang and Wolf moving as normal and Grip moving 3&quot; towards the
bad guys, who move so as to be <i>just</i> over 6&quot; away from the hounds.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 5</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_1321.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1321.JPG" alt="Turn 5, North" title="Turn 5, North" width="250" height="188"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_1320.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1320.JPG" alt="Turn 5, South" title="Turn 5, South" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 6-3.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Wolf holds his ground, while the other two dogs move 3&quot;.  The Ruffians, unable to avoid raising the alarm,
Charge.  While moving to engage, the Ruffian with a whip lashes out at Grip and kills him!  The southern flank is undefended now and the
three Ruffians there high-tail it towards the exit edge of the board.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Thing work out better for Good in the north, where two of the Ruffians fail their Courage tests and stay in place,
while the lone bowman brave enough to Charge loses his Combat and he goes down to Fang's teeth and claws.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 6</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_1323.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1323.JPG" alt="Turn 6, North" title="Turn 6, North" width="250" height="188"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_1324.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1324.JPG" alt="Turn 6, South" title="Turn 6, South" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 2-1.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil gets Priority for the first time in the game.  In the north, one archer has the gumption to Charge Fang, while
the other decides that a sure movement towards the edge is better than having to make a Courage test and (probably) staying in place.</p>

<p class="initialCap">In the south, the Ruffians jump the fence, the whipmaster continuing his run of luck and, rolling a '6', having the
fence not slow down his movement one whit.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Maggot doesn't enter this turn, but Good is still delighted when Fang chomps the Ruffian brave enough to engage him.</p>

<p class="initialCap">With two models down, every Ruffian now has to make it off the board to win.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 7</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_1326.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1326.JPG" alt="Turn 7" title="Turn 7" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 3-3.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Fang and Wolf Charge into the last bowman.  Maggot still doesn't enter, so the other Ruffians continue their run
to the board edge.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The lone Ruffian gets his '6' in combat but so do the dogs and they win on Fight value.  The Ruffian goes down
to Fang and Evil can now no longer win.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 8</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_1328.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1328.JPG" alt="Turn 8" title="Turn 8" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 5-4.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Having Priority, the Ruffians rush forward, with the edge of the board now very close.  The
dogs leave the corpses of the Ruffians in the north to come back to aid Maggot, who <i>finally</i> decides to show up. But the
dogs are still a considerable distance away and there are fences in between which will likely slow them down.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 9</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_1330.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1330.JPG" alt="Turn 9" title="Turn 9" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 6-3.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Maggot moves to engage the dangerous and lucky whipster -- no ranged attack for the Ruffians this turn! -- but
is surrounded by the remaining two thugs.  He trusts in his new Attack 2 attribute to save him, but his Duel roll is an unlucky
snake-eyes. So the Ruffians easily win, and Maggot suffers the four Wounds needed to guarantee that his Fate cannot save him.</p>

<p class="initialCap">With nothing in their way and the hounds far off, the three Ruffians can easily stroll off the board to a drawn game.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Post-game Thoughts</h3>

<p class="initialCap">I like the changes to this scenario. Especially the upgunning of Maggot, even though it did him no good here.
If using the old Sentry rules, the early Priority rolls heavily favoring Good would probably have seen the alarm raised even earlier; the new
rules worked well to prevent that.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The low model count, Attack, and Defense values make this scenario wildly variable as every model counts and every
model is quite vulnerable to Wounds.  Had Maggot won his Combat, he wouldn't have required crazy luck to wipe out the Ruffians before the
game ended.  But it's also easy to imagine the Fang dying in his first combat, too, which probably would have meant an Evil victory.</p>

<p class="initialCap">I think the scenario works well for what it is.  It looks great and is very thematic.</p>
