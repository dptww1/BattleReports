<h1>Short Cuts Make Long Delays</h1>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<p class="initialCap">After completing a big hill and some tree-basing I
was in the mood for a game and this scenario from the new <em>Fellowship of the Ring</em>
supplement (for Games Workshop's <em>Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game</em>) fit the bill.
This was another solo effort.  I still haven't finished painting my hobbits, though!</p>

<h3>Setup</h3>

<p><a href="Images/thIMG_1520.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1520.jpg" alt="Setup" title="Setup"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Frodo, Sam, and Pippin begin at the hedge by the side of the road.
(Sure, it looks like a fence, but it's a hedge.)  Their job is to protect Frodo, exiting him
off the hills at the east edge of the board.  Gildor the elf (he looks like Legolas, but he's
Gildor) begins on the east edge and will provide some welcome support.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Arrayed against them are three Ringwraiths, one each on the North, South,
and West edges of the map.  The Ringwraiths have but one objective: kill Frodo.  There are no draws
in this scenario.  Unfortunately, the Ringwraiths begin here randomly lowered Will.  In this case,
the Western RW begins with 7 Will but the two others get only 5W -- a slightly below average result.</p>

<p class="initialCap">On the other hand, the hobbits begin lost in the woods and until discovered
by the wraiths must make Courage tests to move.  If they fail, Evil gets to move them instead!  Also,
the wraiths once per game may use their terrible cries to lower enemy courage by three.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Yet Evil is hampered also, in that the wraiths don't know where the hobbits
are and so begin on sentry duty.  Since sentries are often moved by the player with priority, those priority
rolls are crucial.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 1</h3>

<p><a href="Images/thIMG_1522.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1522.jpg" alt="Turn 1" title="Turn 1"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Sam fails his very first courage test and heads towards the closest wraith.
Fortunately for Good, the enemy is too distant for there to be any danger of awakening them.  The other
Good characters move to meet in the center of the board.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 2</h3>

<p><a href="Images/thIMG_1525.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1525.jpg" alt="Turn 2" title="Turn 2"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil gets priority but two wraiths roll a '1' on the Sentry table and stay
asleep.  Good is feeling pretty happy about that until it's Frodo's turn to move and he fails his
Courage test.  Evil moves him due west, towards the wraith there and away from Gildor.  Good moves
Pippin along as Frodo's bodyguard while Sam goes to meet Gildor.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 3</h3>

<p><a href="Images/thIMG_1530.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1530.jpg" alt="Turn 3" title="Turn 3"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil priority.  The wraiths take a few baby steps forward and the hobbits
race east.  Sam contacts Gildor.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 4</h3>

<p><a href="Images/thIMG_1533.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1533.jpg" alt="Turn 4" title="Turn 4"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil wins priority again and the ringwraiths all roll fives.  At least
they're moving, but Good passes all his courage rolls again, too.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 5</h3>

<p><a href="Images/thIMG_1538.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1538.jpg" alt="Turn 5" title="Turn 5"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil takes priority yet again.  The southern ringwraith gets close enough to
sight the hobbits, though I foolishly moved him last so that he's the only wraith that can cast a spell
this turn.  He tries to <em>Compel</em> Frodo, using two Will points.  Frodo spends 2 Will to resist, but
rolls low and puts the ring on!  Unfortunately, since Evil moved first, Frodo then gets an opportunity
to take it back off again and does so.  Gildor charges the closest wraith but is wounded for his pains
and his single Fate point avails him not.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 6</h3>

<p><a href="Images/thIMG_1540.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1540.jpg" alt="Turn 6" title="Turn 6"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Before the Priority roll, the Nazgul call with their piercing cry to prevent
being rushed this turn.  Good wins priority, and with lowered courage decides to make a run for it
with Frodo protected on all sides by the others.  But each wraith <em>Compel</em>s Frodo, who manages
to resist the first two but succumbs to the third, so he gets moved out from behind his friends and
the wraith moves to engage him.  Fortunately for Good, the plucky hobbit wins and forces the nazgul
back.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 7</h3>

<p><a href="Images/thIMG_1543.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1543.jpg" alt="Turn 7" title="Turn 7"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good again wins priority.  Frodo manages to take off the ring and runs east.
Gildor tries to rush a nazgul but rolls a '3' and so fails his courage test and stands there as if petrified.
Sam and Pippin do their best to protect Frodo, but one wraith penetrates their screen.  All the wraiths
will Frodo to put on the ring, but luck has deserted Evil and Frodo keeps it off and even manages to
win his combat.  The enemy wraith dissolves, having used his last Will point to engage Frodo.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 8</h3>

<p><a href="Images/thIMG_1550.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1550.jpg" alt="Turn 8" title="Turn 8"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil gets priority but Will points are running low.  Trusting to luck,
one wraith <em>Compel</em>s Frodo, who succumbs.  Both wraiths rush him, beat him, and wound him!
It's now down to the Fate dierolls -- if they fail, Evil has won!  But this is Frodo we're talking about,
and two Fate points leave him without a scratch.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 9</h3>

<p><a href="Images/thIMG_1555.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1555.jpg" alt="Turn 9" title="Turn 9"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil wins priority again.  One wraith, low on Will, runs east to await
developments while the remaining wraith charges Frodo.  A question came up: Can Frodo attempt to take
off the ring when charged?  The rules are not entirely clear, but when I rolled for control of Frodo
Evil won anyway, so the question was moot and Frodo kept the ring on.  The remaining good characters
charged to the aid of their companion, and Gildor delivered the <em>coup de grace</em>.

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 10</h3>

<p><a href="Images/thIMG_1563.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1563.jpg" alt="Turn 10" title="Turn 10"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good wins priority and, with little to fear from a single wraith with one Will
point, ambles towards the east edge.  The wraith spitefully charges Pippin, the only character that he
might kill in one combat.  However, doughty Pippin wins the fight and the ringwraith dissolves into
the nothingness that is his fate.

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Post-game Thoughts</h3>

<p class="initialCap">This is a pretty interesting scenario, though as always much depends on the
dierolls. I obviously still need to master ringwraith tactics.  <em>Compel</em> seems like such a great spell because
as Evil you really want Frodo wearing that ring, but it's probably better to <em>Drain Courage</em> a bit
first so that once he puts on the ring he has trouble removing it.</p>
