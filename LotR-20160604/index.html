<h1>The Fall of Amon Barad</h1>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<p class="initialCap">This is a scenario of Games Workshop's <i>Middle
Earth Strategy Battle Game</i>, the first in the
<i>A Shadow in the East</i> sourcebook.</p>

<p class="initialCap">A squad of Minas Tirith warriors, led by Cirion,
is camping for the night at Amon Barad in Ithilien.  Keeping watch are six
Rangers of Gondor.  An force of ten Easterlings is surreptiously
creeping up on the tower, but the Good forces have an even uglier surprise
in store as Khamûl the Easterling has infiltrated the tower and is killing
its inhabitants.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The goal is to be the only side with men within 6" of the
tower on or after the start of turn seven.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Good starts with his force inactive.  Only the Rangers can
move, and they are subject to the Sentinel rules until they detect the Evil troops.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Khamûl appears at the tower door at the end of the Evil move
on a 4+, beginning on turn three.</p>

<h3>The Forces</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_0552.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0552.JPG" alt="Evil Forces" title="Evil Forces" width="250" height="188"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_0555.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0555.JPG" alt="Good Forces" title="Good Forces" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">The Evil forces are 4 bowmen, 4 swordsmen, and 2 spearmen, led by Khamûl, here proxied with a regular
ringwraith in much the same pose.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Good forces are 4 bowmen, 4 swordsmen, 4 spearmen, and 6 rangers, led by Cirion. One of the campfires
is from the Weathertop set, while the other two are scratchbuilt from green stuff.</p>

<p class="initialCap">From the purely practical standpoint of purchasing the forces needed for this scenario, those numbers correspond
exactly to what you get in a box of Easterlings, a box of Warriors of Minas Tirith, two blister packs of Rangers of Gondor, and the Cirion
and Khamûl blisters.  Pretty nice.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Setup</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_0557.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0557.JPG" alt="Setup, West" title="Setup, West" width="250" height="188"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_0558.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0558.JPG" alt="Setup, East" title="Setup, East" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">The campfires are placed at least 6" away from the tower and each other.  The Warriors of Minas Tirith and Cirion
begin equally distributed amongst the campfires, while the rangers deploy near the board edge.  I placed the latter in a sort of
hexagon pattern; there are two which are out of frame below the edge of the pictures.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 1</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_0562.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0562.JPG" alt="Turn 1" title="Turn 1" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">As always, Good starts a scenario with Priority.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Rangers sense some disturbance in the tower and head towards it as fast as their Sentinel rolls will allow.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Easterlings enter from the far corner, staying well out of sighting radius of the nearby rangers.  Taking a
potshot at a ranger has about a 1/3 chance of a kill but a 2/3 chance of failing and hence raising the alarm, so the bowmen keep their
arrows to themselves.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 2</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_0564.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0564.JPG" alt="Turn 2" title="Turn 2" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 3-2.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Easterlings march in single-file towards the tower.  The rangers, almost as if by plan, move in the opposite
direction.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 3</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_0568.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0568.JPG" alt="Turn 3, Center" title="Turn 3, Center" width="250" height="188"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_0566.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0566.JPG" alt="Turn 3, Easterling Main Body" title="Turn 3, Easterling Main Body" width="250" height="188"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_0567.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0567.JPG" alt="Turn 3, Right" title="Turn 3, Right" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 3-2.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The closest ranger hears some noises nearby and goes to investigate.  He comes upon the Easterling column and raises the
alarm. Leaping into action, the rest of the Good forces start moving towards the enemy incursion.  The exceptions are a few rangers whose
bows (or, more properly, arrows) can reach the enemy, who stay in place to shoot without penalty.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Easterlings swarm the alarm raiser.  Khamûl fails to appear.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Shooting is relatively deadly this turn.  The rangers kill two (including one bowman) and the reduced Evil bow contingent
succeeds in killing one ranger in return.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Combat sees the alarm-raiser easily slain, evening the casualty count to 2 each.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 4</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_0570.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0570.JPG" alt="Turn 4" title="Turn 4" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 5-3.</p>

<p class="initialCap">To better show the action, the camera angle is now from the eastern edge, which is counterclockwise around the board
from the previous orientation.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil consolidates but stays out of charge range.  Khamûl is still busy in the tower.  The Gondorians advance.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Shooting sees another Easterling fall to a ranger.  The attrition rates are definitely in favor of the already
more-numerous Good forces.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 5</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_0573.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0573.JPG" alt="Turn 5" title="Turn 5" width="250" height="188"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_0574.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0574.JPG" alt="Turn 5, Khamûl!" title="Turn 5, Khamûl!" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 5-3.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Good forces get stuck in.  The Easterling bowmen remain stationary to maximize their shooting, while the rest of their
warriors move to the melee.</p>

<p class="initialCap">But what's this at the doorway?  Khamûl finally appears.  He can't do anything on the turn he enters, but since
Good moved first, they can't really react to him, either.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Shooting is ineffective.</p>

<p class="initialCap">There are two combats.  In one, two Minas Tirith warriors face a single Easterling.  Despite the advantage of numbers,
the Easterling wins and slays one of his attackers.  In the other combat, three Easterlings gang up on one Minas Tirith warrior ... and lose.
Fortunately for Evil, the Good warrior fails to wound.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Casualties: 3 Good, 3 Evil</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 6</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_0578.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0578.JPG" alt="Turn 6, the field" title="Turn 6, the field" width="250" height="188"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_0576.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0576.JPG" alt="Turn 6, the tower" title="Turn 6, the tower" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 6-1.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Khamûl charges the Ranger.  Might as well get attack the guys with higher Courage; the Warriors of Minas Tirith have less
than a 50% chance of countercharging, given the ringwraith's <i>Harbinger of Evil</i> special rule.  And the odds work out about right; one warrior
joins the ranger, but the others are stuck in place.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Amongst the warriors' combat, the winners are about evenly divided but no one on either side lands a wound.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Khamûl spends a Might point to go to 2 Attacks.  Unfortunately, he gets a 3-highest against the Good 5-highest. Is it
worth spending both of the only Evil Might points?  Good has only two strikes, and both need 6/4, so Evil decides to let Good win.  Inevitably,
one of the strikes gets 6/5, and Khamûl must rely on his Fate to prevent the end of the game!</p>

<p class="initialCap">Prolonging the agony for Evil, the first Fate roll is a '2'.  Again, is it worth spending both Might points?  Eventually
I decided no, and luckily enough, the second Fate roll was '6'.  The game will continue, with Khamûl down to 8 Will and no Fate.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 7</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_0581.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0581.JPG" alt="Turn 7, the field" title="Turn 7, the field" width="250" height="188"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_0582.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0582.JPG" alt="Turn 7, the tower" title="Turn 7, the tower" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 6-4.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Cirion calls a Heroic Move.  Khamûl counters, but Good gets the nod.  But only one of his warriors follows him.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The scrum goes Good's way, killing two Easterlings at the cost of a single warrior.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Khamûl again spends a Will to go to 2 Attacks.  Both sides get the '6' and the ringwraith wins on Fight value.  He
slays the bowman and wounds Cirion by spending his last Might point.  Cirion's Fate roll fails.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Casualties: 5 Good, 5 Evil</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 8</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_0585.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0585.JPG" alt="Turn 8, the field" title="Turn 8, the field" width="250" height="188"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_0584.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0584.JPG" alt="Turn 8, the tower" title="Turn 8, the tower" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 2-2.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The dwindling Easterlings are mobbed.  There are a lot of troops near Khamûl, but most of them (including Cirion!)
fail their Courage tests and so only a warrior and a ranger succeed in engaging him.  Way to lead, Cirion....</p>

<p class="initialCap">Two more Easterlings go down, but Khamûl (again going to 2 Attacks) wins his combat and slays the ranger.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 9</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_0587.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0587.JPG" alt="Turn 9, the tower" title="Turn 9, the tower" width="250" height="188"></a>
<a href="Images/IMG_0588.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0588.JPG" alt="Turn 9, the field" title="Turn 9, the field" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 4-2.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The slaughter of the Easterling warriors continues.  Cirion Heroic Strikes (now he's out of Might) but for
naught as he just straight-up wins the fight against Khamûl, though no wounds are inflicted.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 10</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_0590.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0590.JPG" alt="Turn 10" title="Turn 10" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 6-1.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Khamûl tries to Drain Courage on Cirion, but he gets a 2-highest and the spell fails.  The remaining
Easterling warrior -- there's only one now -- runs, and the Good warriors are too far away to engage him this turn.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Cirion and a ranger manage to engage Khamûl, and despite 3 dice against 1, Evil wins and Cirion is slain!</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 11</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_0592.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0592.JPG" alt="Turn 11" title="Turn 11" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 5-3.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Good swamps the two remaining Evil models, and wins both the combats.  The Easterling is easily slain,
but despite 8 strikes against Khamûl only one gets a '6', and then the followup is a '3' instead of the needed '4'.  So
the nazgûl lives for another turn, although at this point he is down to 2 Will.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 12</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/IMG_0594.JPG"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_0594.JPG" alt="Turn 12" title="Turn 12" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 2-2.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Courage tests again run generally against Good.  Khamûl risks 1 Will to go to 2 Attacks, but loses.  Although
the Good forces again fail to inflict a wound, Khamûl must then lose another Will point for being in a combat, and he goes *poof*!</p>

<p class="initialCap">Despite losing seven warriors and Cirion, the Good side has won!</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Post-game Thoughts</h3>

<p class="initialCap">That was not particularly even.  Sometimes I
<a href="http://www.davetownsend.org/Battles/LotR-20160528/">blame</a> the
<a href="http://www.davetownsend.org/Battles/LotR-20090208/">scenario</a>,
and I still think that the Easterlings have a surprisingly uphill battle, considering that
"historically" they won.  But I think I used
some poor tactics as the Evil player, and that certainly didn't help any.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Instead of entering as far away as possible, it would be better for the Easterlings to
creep up on one of the camping bands and ambush them.  It wouldn't take too much luck for ten warriors to
slay three, if not all four, of the sleepers, which would considerably even the odds.</p>

<p class="initialCap">If that puts the warriors closer to Khamûl so that they can cooperate, so much the better.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Still, there might need to be a bit of tweaking here.  The attackers are outnumbered almost
2-1, and although Khamûl seems capable, he can't win by himself, as the above shows.  So some tweaks might be
in order.  The rangers were fearsomely efficient in my replay.  It might be worth limiting their
range, and/or giving them a penalty on their shooting roll.  It <i>is</i> supposed to be dark outside, after all.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Or maybe the Easterling warriors should be led by a Captain?</p>

<p class="initialCap">The situation here is interesting enough it seems worth playing with a bit to get it right.</p>
