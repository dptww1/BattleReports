<h1>The Horse and the Serpent</h1>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<p class="initialCap">My run through the old <i>Return of the King</i> Journeybook scenarios continues with
The Horse and the Serpent.  This is a book-only scenario where Th&eacute;oden squares off against
the leader of the cruel Haradrim, Suladân.  This is a very straightforward scenario, a duel to the death between
those leaders.</p>

<h3>The Forces</h3>

<p>

<a href="Images/2018-09-25_18.12.46.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/th2018-09-25_18.12.46.jpg" alt="Evil Forces" title="Evil Forces" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">The Good forces here are Th&eacute;oden, Gamling, Éowyn, Merry, 3 Royan Royal Guard, and 18 Riders of Rohan.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Opposing them are Suladân, two Haradrim Chieftains, 5 Serpent Guard, and 16 Haradrim Raiders.  There are some substitutions here, because
in prepping for this scenario I painted up two boxes of Haradrim Raiders and failed my Courage test when I realized I technically needed to paint yet more
horsemen.  So the raider with a white gemstone on his base is actually a Haradrim Chieftain, and the Raider models with yellow gemstones are Serpent Riders.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Suladân model is <i>not</i> a substitution, though. This the old man-in-the-iron-mark version. Many folks seem to prefer the current
Zulu-ish model, but I rather like the look of this one, while conceding that metal face armor in what's ostensibly a desert-based army is an off-beat choice.</p>

<h3>Setup</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/2018-09-25_18.20.19.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/th2018-09-25_18.20.19.jpg" alt="Setup" title="Setup" width="250" height="188"></a>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Here we are in the Pelennor Fields, with the two lines facing each other.  There's some random terrain down for visual interest but
none of it will affect play.  Both leaders hide behind some friends, as there are a lot of bows on both sides and it would be a shame to lose the game on
Turn 1 if the archery is especially accurate!</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 1</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/2018-11-11_13.32.14.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/th2018-11-11_13.32.14.jpg" alt="Turn 1" title="Turn 1" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good always gets Priority on the first turn.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Riders of Rohan advance a half move so their numerous bows can fire and the Haradrim, with plenty of firepower themselves, respond in kind.</p>

<p class="initialCap">But the Shoot Phase is as unlethal as I've ever seen.  The Riders take eighteen shots, of which only four hit and none wound.  The Haradrim reply
with a volley of their own but though they score a couple more hits and have poisoned arrows they, too, fail to score a single wound.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 2</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/2018-11-12_18.46.49.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/th2018-11-12_18.46.49.jpg" alt="Turn 2" title="Turn 2" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 5-4.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Th&eacute;oden does some thinking.  The only thing that matters in this scenario is killing Suladân. The models he's hiding behind
make it hard to get him through shooting.  But Good has seven points of Might to Evil's five, and also also has the Banner of Rohan, which restores
a Might point to nearby heroes that have used all theirs up.  So Good has no incentive to save Might.  Let's use the relatively rare Heroic Accuracy
to target Suladân and help with those pesky In the Way rolls.</p>

<p class="initialCap">With this in mind, the Riders again advance a half move, while Th&eacute;oden and Éowyn spread out a bit to get as many Riders as
they can under their 6&quot; umbrella.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil sees what's going on -- the disadvantage of solitaire play is that it's difficult to truly surprise yourself -- and uses the same
logic to determine that he should force an early engagement.  After all, the longer the game goes on, the greater the Might point differential is going to
work in Good's favor.  So while the horse archers move half to fire, the lancers charge!</p>

<p class="initialCap">Th&eacute;oden and Merry then call Heroic Accuracies.  (Merry is a better choice than Éowyn because, with a single Might point,
he's out of Might immediately and so gets it right back next turn.)  But Good shooting continues to disappoint ... except for one lucky arrow which reaches
Suladân and inflicts a Wound, drawing the Serpent Lord's single Fate point.  Otherwise, the sole shooting result is dismounting a Serpent Guard.  Big deal.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil shooting is even worse, though, being entirely ineffectual.  I've never seen so many '2's and '3's.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 3</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/2018-11-12_19.10.50.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/th2018-11-12_19.10.50.jpg" alt="Turn 3" title="Turn 3" width="250" height="188"></a>
<a href="Images/2018-11-12_19.12.05.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/th2018-11-12_19.12.05.jpg" alt="Turn 3 pre Heroic Combat" title="Turn 3 pre Heroic Combat" width="250" height="188"></a>
<a href="Images/2018-11-12_19.13.11.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/th2018-11-12_19.13.11.jpg" alt="Turn 3 post Heroic Combat" title="Turn 3 post Heroic Combat" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 5-4.  Merry regains his Might point.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil, seeing a potential path to Th&eacute;oden, considers calling a Heroic Move. But careful measurement shows that the gap between the bases isn't quite
wide enough to admit a cavalry model.  Good vows to be more careful and takes his move.</p>

<p class="initialCap">With numerical superiority, the Riders charge the Haradrim, the leaders hanging back to remain within Gamling's banner range.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil spots another opportunity, though.  Suladân and a Chieftain move up and engage a Rider, with the Captain calling a Heroic Combat (2nd image). With five dice
against one, the Rider is dispatched handily.  It's too risky to send Suladân behind enemy lines ... but the Chieftain maneuvers through the new gap and manages
to engage Th&eacute;oden! (3rd image)</p>

<p class="initialCap">The subsequent Combat rolls are tragic for both sides, Good getting '2', '1' vs Evil's '3', '1'.</p>

<p class="initialCap">At this point Th&eacute;oden spent his last Might point to tie, only to have the Chieftain spend <i>his</i> last point to win, and he rolls boxcars to Wound.
Naturally both of Th&eacute;oden's Fate rolls failed (because that's always how it goes, right?) and that's the end of the game!</p>

<p class="initialCap">That is, until I remembered that Th&eacute;oden is in banner range!  So he re-rerolls his '1', gets a '4' to win (if only barely) and though he can't Wound the Chieftain,
he does kill his horse.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The game is still afoot!  (Especially for the Chieftain....)

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 4</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/2018-11-14_21.35.41.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/th2018-11-14_21.35.41.jpg" alt="Turn 4" title="Turn 4" width="250" height="188"></a>
<a href="Images/2018-11-14_21.36.26.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/th2018-11-14_21.36.26.jpg" alt="Turn 4, west" title="Turn 4, west" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 5-2.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Th&eacute;oden calls a Heroic Move so as to Charge the Chieftain and Suladân.  The latter counters, but Good wins the rolloff.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Two Riders move in to attack the Serpent King, with a throwing spear actually landing another Wound on the way in.  The subsequent Combat roll is a
disaster for Evil, '1', '3', '4' against Good's '2', '6'.  Fortunately Suladân has a banner in range; unfortunately, his reroll is only a '4'.  Is it worth Suladân's last
two Might points to win?  He's down to two Wounds and no Fate, so if he loses and both of the Riders inflict a Wound it's game over.  So, yeah, as painful as it is, it
seems worth the Might expenditure. Suladân wins the combat and kills both of the Riders' horses.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The now-dismounted Chieftain is surrounded by the Rohan heroes but gamely sets the bar at a '6', which requires a banner reroll for Good to win
due to higher Fight value.  The Chieftain is then ridden down.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Elsewhere the victories are split as two Riders and two Haradrim are slain.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 5</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/2018-11-14_21.56.52.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/th2018-11-14_21.56.52.jpg" alt="Turn 5" title="Turn 5" width="250" height="188"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 6-2.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Th&eacute;oden regains a Might point. Éowyn calls a Heroic Move. Evil has only 2 Might points left on the board (both on the still-mounted Haradrim
Chieftain) but Suladân is vulnerable, so the Chieftain counters.  Good wins the roll-off <i>again</i> and charges.</p>

<p class="initialCap">If Suladân is vulnerable, so is Th&eacute;oden, so the Chieftain spends Evil's last Might point to call a Heroic Combat, hoping to join Suladân against
the King of Rohan.  But the latter sees what's up and spends his newly-minted Might point to counter.  The dice finally go Evil's way and so the Chieftain's Combat is first.
He easily defeats the two dismounted Rohirrim, but his Wound rolls are a disastrous '2', '3' -- he not only fails to defeat them both, he can't even kill <i>one</i>!</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil's run of bad luck continues as Suladân's Combat roll is '2', '2', '3'.  Unfortunately for him, Éowyn gets the '6' and then rolls '6', '6' to Wound
to deliver the <i>coup de grâce</i> and win the game for Good!</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Post-game Thoughts</h3>

<p class="initialCap">I think Good has an advantage in this scenario despite the old Th&eacute;oden profile used here. Which seems only proper given what "historically" happened.</p>

<p class="initialCap">But the dice were definitely against Evil here.  Good had Priority most every turn and won the Heroic Move roll-offs the couple of time when they didn't.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Yet only a banner re-roll saved Th&eacute;oden from a disastrous turn 3 loss. So it definitely seems possible for Harad to win this scenario.</p>

<p class="initialCap">If I have any criticism, it's how little most of the forces matter.  Each side gets d3 troops back from the dead pile every turn,
which makes the combats and shooting not involving the leaders seem a bit pointless.  It might improve the scenario just to ignore that rule.</p>
