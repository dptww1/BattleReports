<h1>The Last March of the Ents</h1>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<p class="initialCap">This is a second go at a <i>Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game</i> scenario
from the Two Towers Journeybook.  You may want to read my
<a href="http://www.davetownsend.org/Battles/LotR-20150922/">previous attempt</a> before going further.  (I
guess that playthrough is now technically "The Penultimate March of the Ents".)

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Setup Changes</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/img001.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img001.jpg" alt="Revised Evil Force" title="Revised Evil Force"></a>
<a href="Images/img002.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img002.jpg" alt="Setup" title="Setup"></a>
</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Evil force was just too strong as originally played.  So I chopped down the
Uruk-hai from 22 Warriors down to 12.  To keep up the number of models I added more Orcs, though not as many
as you might think at first glance because I lowered the overall points of the Evil force from 576 to 554 as well.
(In the image, one of the bowmen evidentally hates the Uruks
more than the Ents based on his facing.  There's one in every crowd....)</p>

<p class="initialCap">It seemed to me that the my original board layout also penalized the Ents, since the
large outcrop in combination with the crevice paralleling the start edge channeled the Ents too much and made
Barging too hard.  So I've arranged the crevices here more or less perpendicular to the Ents movement.  This
should help the Ents, who can easily step over the crevices, and hinder the Evil forces, which must either go
around or take dangerous Jump tests.</p>

<p class="initialCap">My last change for this playthrough was to reduce the chance of Evil Warriors coming
back into play from 50% to 33%.  I like the uncertainty for both sides that this rule engenders, but the return
rate just seemed too favorable to Evil last time out.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Ents are, left to right, Birch, Treebeard, Linden, and Quickbeam</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 1</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/img003.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img003.jpg" alt="Turn 1" title="Turn 1"></a>
</p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority</p>

<p class="initialCap">As always, Good starts a scenario with Priority.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Ents begin within Throw Stones range of the closest scaffold, and are in fact
within a couple of inches throwing range of the second as well.  So what's the rush to close with the
enemy?  If Evil holds back, too, the resulting shooting battle is only going to go in favor of the Ents
due to their higher strength and defense.  So, despite being presented with Priority on a plate, the Ents
anticlimatically choose to stay in place and reach for stones.</p>

<p class="initialCap">In response, Evil advances as much as possible. In the interest of speed, most of
the Orcs on scaffold jump off rather than use the ladders.  Only one Orc dies on each of the far
scaffolds, but on the foreground scaffold an improbable four warriors fall to their doom.  In retrospect, feeding the
Orcs bananas was not a good idea, though you'd think they'd just throw the peels into the crevice.</p>

<p class="initialCap">In the Shooting Phase all four Ents throw their stones at the nearest scaffold.
Three hit and two of those hits damage the scaffold (note the black poker chips on the platform). Evil
exact their revenge, though, with a lucky Orc scoring a wound on Treebeard, which he in turn negates
with a Fate point.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil dead: permanent 0, this turn 6.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 2</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/img004.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img004.jpg" alt="Turn 2" title="Turn 2"></a>
</p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 3-2</p>

<p class="initialCap">Since the closest Evil models are nearing the Ents, the Birch Ent moves to intercept
them while the other three remain in place so they can throw stones.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil moves towards the Ents, a few warriors charging the Birch Ent.
Two of the dead warriors from last turn return to play.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Good's shooting is miserable, with no one rolling higher than an two.  But Evil's
Shooting all whiffs as well.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The first combat of the game goes poorly for the Birch Ent, who can manage
on a 4 against the Evil 5.  Luckily he takes only one wound.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil dead: permanent 4, this turn 0.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 3</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/img005.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img005.jpg" alt="Turn 3 Movement" title="Turn 3 Movement"></a>
<a href="Images/img006.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img006.jpg" alt="Turn 3 Quickbeam's Hurl" title="Turn 3 Quickbeam's Hurl"></a>
<a href="Images/img007.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img007.jpg" alt="Turn 3 Treebeard" title="Turn 3 Treebeard"></a>
</p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 4-2.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Evil forces are close enough that Treebeard and Quickbeam move to cut them off, too,
leaving the Linden Ent to reach for a stone.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil swarms the Ents.  The Linden Ent does indeed manage to damage the nearest scaffold through
shooting, while all of the Evil shots fail to wound.  In several cases this works to Evil's benefit, since a few
of the shots hit friendly warriors engaged in melee rather than the enemy.</p>

<p class="initialCap">In combat, Quickbeam gets his 6 and Hurls a Berserker 8".  Only three models die (the ones
facing left) but the casualties include the Uruk-hai Bannerman.  The Berserker ends up on the crevice.  The rules
do not mention what happens in this case; I decided that hurling into the crevice makes for a cool game mechanic,
but gave the model being thrown a saving throw of 6 to catch hold of the edge.  And indeed the Berserker gets his
6 and remains.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Treebeard gets only a 5 highest but Evil does no better and the Ent wins on Fight value.  He
decides to just strike normally, and kills two enemies.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Birch Ent agains rolls a 4 highest against Evil's 6, but the Isengarders fail to wound.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil dead: permanent 4, this turn 5.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 4</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/img008.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img008.jpg" alt="Turn 4 Movement" title="Turn 4 Movement"></a>
<a href="Images/img009.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img009.jpg" alt="Turn 4 Quickbeam's Hurl" title="Turn 4 Quickbeam's Hurl"></a>
<a href="Images/img010.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img010.jpg" alt="Turn 4 Combat" title="Turn 4 Combat"></a>
</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 2-1.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil continues to run at the Ents, and I finally remember that the Ents cause Terror
and at last make Courage tests when Evil tries to Charge.  This thins the number of attackers considerably.
All five models killed last turn stay dead.</p>

<p class="initialCap">By the time it's Good's turn to move, the Linden Ent is the only model that is still
unengaged. He moves up to help the Birch Ent, who seems to be having a rough time.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Shooting has no effect this turn.</p>

<p class="initialCap">In combat, Quickbeam match Evil's 4 and Hurls an Orc 6".  He knocks down a lot, but
everyone survives.  It looks more impressive than it really is.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Birch Ent finally wins 5-4, and Hurls an opponent into the scaffold.  Neither the
hurled Orc nor the scaffold he hits are wounded, but the Berserker he passes through on the way is killed.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Linden Ent beats his brave lone attacker easily and Hurls him at the Uruk Captain.
The thrown Orc and an Orc in between both die, but the Captain is unscathed.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Treebeard barely wins, 4-4, and attempts to Barge to get at the Orc Banner Bearer.
But he rolls a miserable 1 and can't reach anyone at all!</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil dead: permanent 9, this turn 4.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 5</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/img011.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img011.jpg" alt="Turn 5 Movement" title="Turn 5 Movement"></a>
<a href="Images/img012.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img012.jpg" alt="Turn 5 Quickbeam's Hurl" title="Turn 5 Quickbeam's Hurl"></a>
<a href="Images/img013.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img013.jpg" alt="Turn 5 Combat" title="Turn 4 Combat"></a>
</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 6-5.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil charges, but suffers a great number of Courage Test failures and when the dust
settles the Linden Ent is still free to move.  He moves up to block the gap between Birch and Quickbeam.
Two dead Orcs come back.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Shooting's only casualty is one of the Orcs engaging Quickbeam, hit by friendly fire.</p>

<p class="initialCap">In combat, Quickbeam's 4 loses to Evil's 6.  With an already-large number of strikes
doubled due to being trapped, and the +1 Wound modifier for two-handed weapons, Evil manages to inflict three
wounds and kills the Ent!</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Linden Ent's opponents get a 6 but so does the Ent. He Hurls his opponent 8" through
the line of troops rushing him and manages to kill five(!) of them.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Birch Ent likewise matches the Evil roll of 6. He Barges 3" to attack a prone Orc
and the Orc Banner Bearer, and though his followup attack only gets a 5 that still beat's Evil's 4 highest
and the Ent kills them both.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Treebeard's 4 matches Evil's 4 highest and he Barges into the Orc behind him in
order to prevent being trapped next turn.  The Orc rolls a 6 but his two-handed weapon reduces that to a 5
which Treebeard matches, and Treebeard takes him out.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil dead: permanent 11, this turn 10.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 6</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/img014.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img014.jpg" alt="Turn 6 Movement" title="Turn 6 Movement"></a>
<a href="Images/img015.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img015.jpg" alt="Turn 6 Combat" title="Turn 6 Combat"></a>
</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 6-4.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Again the Orcs and Uruks charge and all the Ents are pinned.  All Shooting is ineffective.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Linden Ent wins his combat with a 6 and uses all three strikes on the Uruk-hai
Captain.  They all succeed in wounding, and the Uruk-hai Captain goes down, taking his two unused points of Might
with him.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Birch Ent loses 5-6 and narrowly escapes wounding, one of the attacking Orcs getting
a 6/3 when needing a 6/4.  Birch has now lost 50% of his combats, which seems pretty weak for an Ent.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Treebeard and his enemies tie again 6-6.  Since Good is trying to thin down the hoard of
Evil forces, and Treebeard has only a single model in base contact, he forgoes regular strikes and Barges 6"
into two others.  His luck holds and kills them both.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil dead: permanent 16 (plus the Uruk Captain), this turn 2.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 7</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/img016.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img016.jpg" alt="Turn 7" title="Turn 7"></a>
</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 6-1.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil charges again but there are many Courage Test failures.  One dead Orc returns.
Shooting is again ineffective.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Linden Ent's string of victories comes to an end as his combat roll comes up with
the dreaded 1,1,1. The Orcs easily win and he is lucky to escape with only two wounds.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Birch Ent's luck is little better -- he scores 1,2,3 -- and the Berserker attacking
him easily wins despite the two-handed weapon penalty.  But no wounds are inflicted.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Good's poor luck continues as Treebeard also loses 5-6 against two measly Orcs. Being
pretty fed up with losing this turn, he spends a Might point to win and easily slays the Orcs using regular strikes.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil dead: permanent 17 (plus Captain), this turn 2.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 8</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/img017.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img017.jpg" alt="Turn 8" title="Turn 8"></a>
</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 5-1.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Things don't change much.  Evil charges, none of the dead revive, and shooting is ineffective.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Linden Ent gets his 6 and kills three enemies using normal strikes.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Birch Ent loses <i>yet again</i>, 4-6, but Evil only manages to inflict one wound.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Treebeard again loses 4-5 and uses a Might point to force the win and kill two enemies.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil dead: permanent 19 (plus Captain), this turn 5.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 9</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/img018.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img018.jpg" alt="Turn 9" title="Turn 9"></a>
</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 2-1.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil's had Priority six turns in a row now, which seems to be seriously impeding
the progress of the Ents.  They are almost as far away from the nearest scaffold as ever, with the only
ray of hope being that the Evil ranks have been pretty seriously thinned out.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil charges, of course, but the Courage Test results are tragic (from Evil's
point of view, anyway).  Only the Orc Captain is willing to attack the Linden Ent, and just two
Orcs are willing to face Treebeard.  A miserly one dead model returns, and shooting remains as ineffective as ever.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Birch Ent finally gets his six; given his wounds and being trapped, this was an
important one to win.  He easily squashes the Berserker but his other two strikes have no effect.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Orc Captain had called a Heroic Strike and gets the 6 dieroll to get F10 for the combat
versus the Linden Ent.  The Ent gets his 6 to the Captain's 5, but the Orc uses his last Might point to force the
tie and then wins on Fight value!  He elects to Piercing Strike but gets only 3,5 on his Wound rolls and, with
no Might remaining, can't scratch the Ent.  Disappointing for Evil; still, the Orc Captain showed that namby-pamby
Uruk-hai Captain how it's done, right?</p>

<p class="initialCap">Treebeard manages just a 3 highest against the Orc with two-handed weapon's adjusted roll
of 5.  There's not enough Might here to fix that, so Treebeard has to take his licks, in this case a single
Wound which is negated by 2 Fate points.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil dead: permanent 23 (plus Captain), this turn 1.</p>

<p><br></p>
<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 10</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/img019.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img019.jpg" alt="Turn 10" title="Turn 10"></a>
</p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 4-2.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Ents back up to engage the models that are trapping them.  Evil charges where Courage
Tests let him.  The dead Berserker from last turn stays dead, and shooting continues to be a lot of die rolling
without any effect.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Linden Ent gets his 6 and inflicts 2 wounds on the Orc Captain, whose only Fate point
saves him.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Birch Ent gets his 6 and scores two more kills.  He's now clawed his way back up to
winning half of his combats, which is still not very impressive.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Treebeard completes the trifecta of wins by also rolling 6, then muffs the wound rolls
by getting 1,2,1.  Sad.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil dead: permanent 24 (plus Captain), this turn 2.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 11</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/img020.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img020.jpg" alt="Turn 11" title="Turn 11"></a>
</p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 5-1.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Ents charge, shifting to the right where Evil is thinner on the ground.  Evil
countercharges and though the Linden and Birch Ents aren't facing many opponents, Treebeard gets swarmed.
Neither dead model returns.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Pippin scores the first hobbit victory by knocking out a two-handed weapon Orc with
a rock.  This seems to wake up the Evil shooters, which kill one in-the-way Orc attacking Treebeard but also
inflict a wound on the always struggling Birch Ent.  That's his third, and down he goes!</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Linden Ent gets his 6 against the Orc Captain, who was Piercing Striking.
The Captain goes down to D4; since he has only one Wound and no Fate remaining, the odds look about the
same whether Linden uses strikes or Hurls him.  But the latter gives the opportunity to take out some
other enemies as well, so Hurl it is.  Luck is with the Ent and the Captain and two warriors passed through
all die.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Treebeard's 4 loses to Evil's 6 and again his single remaining Might point isn't enough
to affect the result.  He endures a fair number of strikes, but S3 Orcs have a hard time against the thick-barked
Ent and he only ends up with 1 wound.

<p class="initialCap">Evil dead: permanent 26 (plus both Captains), this turn 4.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 12</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/img021.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img021.jpg" alt="Turn 12" title="Turn 12"></a>
</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 3-2.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil charges.  Three of the four dead come back. Friendly fire takes down an engaged Orc.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Linden Ent wins 5-5 and kills all three of his attackers.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Treebeard loses 4-6 but the Orcs again fail to wound.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil dead: permanent 27 (plus both Captains), this turn 4.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 13</h3>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 3-2.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Sorry, no picture.  The Ents charge and Evil countercharges. One of the four
dead returns.  Shooting goes back to ineffective.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Linden Ent gets a 3 high and loses, but miraculously survives the numerous Evil strikes.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Treebeard gets his 6 and kills three opponents.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil dead: permanent 30 (plus both Captains), this turn 3.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 14</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/img022.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img022.jpg" alt="Turn 14" title="Turn 14"></a>
</p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 3-1.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Ents close for mutual support in the direction of the scaffold.  Evil moves
in.  Two of last turn's dead return.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The crossbows take out the wounded Linden Ent.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Treebeard gets his 6 in combat and kills two of his attackers.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil dead: permanent 31 (plus both Captains), this turn 2.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 15</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/img023.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img023.jpg" alt="Turn 15" title="Turn 15"></a>
</p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 5-3.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Treebeard runs toward the scaffold, while Evil charges Treebeard where Courage Tests
allow it.  Neither of last turn's casualties return, and shooting again has no effect.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Treebeard gets his 6 and decides to Barge, hoping to engage the scaffold.  Naturally
he rolls a 1 and can't reach it.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil dead: permanent 33 (plus both Captains), this turn 0(!).</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 16</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/img024.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img024.jpg" alt="Turn 16" title="Turn 16"></a>
</p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 6-1.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Treebeard at last reaches the scaffold.  There are only two Orcs in charge
range and both fail their Courage Test.  Shooting has no effect.</p>

<p class="initialCap">With no models in base contact, Treebeard is free to attack the scaffold.
He gets just three hits, but in combination with the wounds inflicted in the first turns of the game,
it's enough to collapse the scaffold!  One down, two to go....</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil dead: permanent 33 (plus both Captains), this turn 2 (archers on the scaffold).</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 17</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/img025.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img025.jpg" alt="Turn 17" title="Turn 17"></a>
</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 4-4.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Treebeard is mobbed.  One archer returns.  Evil's shooting helps out
Treebeard by killing the model ensuring that he was trapped.</p>

<p class="initialCap">In combat, Treebeard loses 5-6 but takes no wounds.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil dead: permanent 34 (plus both Captains), this turn 1.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 18</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/img026.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img026.jpg" alt="Turn 18" title="Turn 18"></a>
</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 2-1.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Treebeard is swarmed, and the dead stay dead.  Shooting again scores an own goal
as Evil takes out an Orc.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Treebeard again loses 4-5, and this time takes a wound. Despite the dwindling
number of Evil models at this point, Treebeard does not seem to be doing well.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil dead: permanent 35 (plus both Captains), this turn 1.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 19</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/img027.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img027.jpg" alt="Turn 19" title="Turn 19"></a>
</p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 3-3.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Treebeard finally gets a change to move and crosses the rubble from the scaffold.
Evil pursues but no one is in charge range. The dead continue to stay dead, and shooting continues to
have no effect.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil dead: permanent 36 (plus both Captains), this turn 0.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 20</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/img028.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img028.jpg" alt="Turn 20" title="Turn 20"></a>
</p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority, 6-4.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Treebeard advances, trying to get behind the rock for some protection against
crossbows.  Evil follows.  A few warriors are within Charge range but none of them pass their Courage Tests
so there's no combat this turn.  Shooting kills an in-the-way Orc.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil dead: permanent 36 (plus both Captains), this turn 0.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 21</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/img029.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/img029.jpg" alt="Turn 21" title="Turn 21"></a>
</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority, 4-2.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Treebeard is mobbed, but it doesn't matter because the crossbows manage to hit him
and inflict a third Wound to kill him. Game over.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Post-game Thoughts</h3>

<p class="initialCap">Just looking at the number of scaffolds that were destroyed,
this would seem to be a repeat of my previous attempt at this scenario.  But I think
this was a much closer contest.  My gut feeling was the Ents didn't have very good luck
during this game.  So I ran some numbers to see if my gut feeling was correct.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Here is the raw data for the combats.  Turns with no combat are
omitted.  A number indicates the highest number rolled by the given Ent that turn; cells with two
numbers are where there were two combats due to Barging. The combat results are
indicated by letter as to <b>W</b>in or <b>L</b>oss, and <b>L &gt; W</b> indicates
a Might point was used to increase the dieroll and change the raw result.</p>

<p class="initialCap">This is actually closer than I thought.  Despite the rare 1,1,1
showing up (for the Linden Ent, ironically, who was otherwise the most
solidly consistent performer) the total number of 1-high, 2-high, and 3-high rolls was
about as should have been expected.  Likewise, the number of 6-highs was right on the
money.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Now the number of 4-highests was significantly over what was expected
and the number of 5-highests was significantly less.  But I don't think changing three
of those 4s to 5s (which would bring the actual results in line with expected results)
would have significantly altered the game. A 5 doesn't guarantee a win, as Treebeard
discovered on Turns 7 and 17.</p>

<p class="initialCap">At this point I am inclined to keep the lower-quality Evil roster,
along with revival on a 5+ (and not 4+ as the scenario states).  I think the final
piece of the playbalance puzzle is adding another Ent, which I think will give the Good
side enough staying power to make destroying two scaffolds probable and outright winning
possible.</p>
