<h1>Kingslayer</h1>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<p class="initialCap">This small scenario for Games Workshop's <em>Lord of the Rings
Strategy Battle Game</em> covers the slaying of King Theoden by the Witch King, and
the revenge wrought by Eowyn and Merry.  It was published in <i>Battle Games in Middle
Earth</i> #74.</p>

<h3>Setup</h3>

<p><a href="Images/Img_2745.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thImg_2745.jpg" alt="Setup" title="Setup"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">The full strength RotK Witch King faces off against two Royal Guard, Theoden,
Eowyn, and Merry on a 2' x 2' board.</p>

<p class="initialCap">I've used a lot of figure substitutions here.  The guy on the Fell Beast
is J. Random Ringwraith rather than the Witch King, Theoden is in his unarmored Warg Attack
guise instead of his RotK armor, and what is supposed to be two Rohan Royal Guard are instead
a RRG Banner Bearer and a regular horseman.  Those stand-ins shouldn't strain credulity too much
though, and I'm using the scenario-given stats regardless. </p>

<p class="initialCap">The victory conditions are as straightforward as it gets: it's a fight to the death.
Not much chance for rules lawyering that.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 1</h3>

<p><a href="Images/Img_2749.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thImg_2749.jpg" alt="Turn 1" title="Turn 1"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good always begins with Priority.  Knowing that the Fell Beast (w/12" move)
wants to charge them so it can dismount them, the Rohirrim advance so as to keep 13" away from it.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil returns the favor by advancing only 1".  The Fell Beast can now charge
the Rohirrim, but not vice versa!  The Witch King decides to see if Theoden wants to come out to play,
and <i>Compel</i>s him forward 5".</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 2</h3>

<p><a href="Images/Img_2750.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thImg_2750.jpg" alt="Turn 2" title="Turn 2"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority.  Evil calls a Heroic Move (-1 Might), which Theoden tries to
counter by expending a Might point of his own.  But Evil wins the roll off and goes first.  He tries to
<i>Compel</i> Theoden forward again, but rolls a '1' and fails.  Now if he charges Theoden the remaining
Good figures will counter-charge and Angmar decides he doesn't like those odds.  So he moves off to
the side where only Theoden can reach him this turn.
</p>

<p class="initialCap">Being a hero and all, Theoden accepts the challenge, passes his Courage test, and
charges the Witch King while the other riders get as close as they can.  If you'd only read the book the charge
might seem foolhardy, but in game terms it's an even-up Combat, two dice per side with equal Fight values.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Both sides roll a '5' in Combat, and both sides spend a Might point to bump
that to a six.  Luck goes with plucky Theoden, though, as Good wins the tiebreaking roll-off.  Theoden strikes
at the Fell Beast (twice as easy to hit as the Witch King) but both rolls fail to wound.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 3 - 5</h3>

<p><a href="Images/Img_2751.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thImg_2751.jpg" alt="Turn 3 Evil Move" title="Turn 3 Evil Move"></a>

<p class="initialCap">Evil priority.  Eowyn calls a Heroic Move, which the Witch King counters with his
last Might point.  Evil wins the tiebreaker.  The Witch King moves as far away as he can, but he won't be able
to get away from the Riders due to the edges of the playing surface.  He decides to switch tactics and aims
a deadly <i>Black Dart</i> at the nearest Rohan Royal Guard, which instantly kills hims.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p><a href="Images/Img_2752.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thImg_2752.jpg" alt="Turn 3 Good Move" title="Turn 3 Good Move"></a>

<p class="initialCap">The remaining Good models pass their Courage tests and charge the Witch King, Eowyn
managing to wound the Fell Beast with her throwing spear as she does so.  The combat rolls tie (6 each) and
Evil wins the tiebreaker.  The Fell Beast strikes Eowyn twice, but does no damage.</p>

<p class="initialCap">At this point the Witch King can no longer escape from the Rohirrim and has no more
Might with which to call heroic moves.  So when Good gets priority in turn 4, all the models charge, with the exception
of the remaining Royal Guard, who fails his Courage test.  However, Evil wins the resulting combat, giving
Eowyn one Wound which she negates with a Fate point.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Turn 5 sees Good getting Priority <i>again</i>, and by now even Merry has caught up
and lends a hand in the melee, which Good wins thanks to Merry spending a Might point to tie the Combat roll
and then winning the tiebreaker.  Aided by the special Eowyn and Merry scenario rules which allow them to
hit the Witch King on a 4+, they easily slaughter the ringwraith and the game ends.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Post-game Thoughts</h3>

<p class="initialCap">Clearly my Ringwraith tactics are a little rusty.  Mulling over how this might work,
it seemed to me that with the 2" movement advantage that the Fell Beast could keep his distance, but the small
playing field is a tough constraint for Evil and the size of the bases and lack of facing and/or turning rules
make dashing over the Rohirrim problematic.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Next time I'll try risking a charge with the Fell Beast.  When he wins a combat, he
automatically unhorses his opposition.  If a 2" advantage isn't enough for hit and run tactics, a 6" (Fell Beast
vs Footmen) is.</p>

<p class="initialCap">This scenario is so small that I can't imagine it being endlessly replayable.  And
yet there seems to be a bit more decision making than I thought at first blush.  It definitely seems worth a few
more plays.</p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Addendum</h3>

<p class="initialCap">Oh no!  I forget about the Witch King's Fate points!  The scenario was by no means
over, unless all three Fate dierolls fails, only 1/8 chance.  I decided to <a href="../LotR-20070531/">try again</a>
using the rules correctly.</p>
