<p class="initialCap">The Evil forces are 4 bowmen, 4 swordsmen, and 2 spearmen, led by Khamûl, here proxied with a regular
ringwraith in much the same pose.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The campfires are placed at least 6" away from the tower and each other.  The Warriors of Minas Tirith and Cirion
begin equally distributed amongst the campfires, while the rangers deploy near the board edge.  I placed the latter in a sort of
hexagon pattern; there are two which are out of frame below the edge of the pictures.</p>

<h3>Post-game Thoughts</h3>

<p class="initialCap">That was not particularly even.  Sometimes I
<a href="http://www.davetownsend.org/Battles/LotR-20160528/">blame</a> the
<a href="http://www.davetownsend.org/Battles/LotR-20090208/">scenario</a>,
and I still think that the Easterlings have a surprisingly uphill battle, considering that
"historically" they won.  But I think I used
some poor tactics as the Evil player, and that certainly didn't help any.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Instead of entering as far away as possible, it would be better for the Easterlings to
creep up on one of the camping bands and ambush them.  It wouldn't take too much luck for ten warriors to
slay three, if not all four, of the sleepers, which would considerably even the odds.</p>

<p class="initialCap">If that puts the warriors closer to Khamûl so that they can cooperate, so much the better.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Still, there might need to be a bit of tweaking here.  The attackers are outnumbered almost
2-1, and although Khamûl seems capable, he can't win by himself, as the above shows.  So some tweaks might be
in order.  The rangers were fearsomely efficient in my replay.  It might be worth limiting their
range, and/or giving them a penalty on their shooting roll.  It <i>is</i> supposed to be dark outside, after all.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Or maybe the Easterling warriors should be led by a Captain?</p>

<p class="initialCap">The situation here is interesting enough it seems worth playing with a bit to get it right.</p>

<p class="initialCap">My rating: <span style="color:goldenrod">★★★★</span>☆</p>
