<h1>Weathertop</h1>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<p class="initialCap">I finally completed my Weathertop scenery after
many months and am pleased with how it turned out, so I decided to solo
this scenario (for Games Workshop's <em>Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game</em>).
The hobbit models are still not detailed, but principal painting is finished
so they're good enough for gaming.</p>

<h3>Setup</h3>

<p><a href="Images/thIMG_1452.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1452.jpg" alt="Setup" title="Setup"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Sam, Merry, and Pippin begin around the fire, cooking
their evening meal.  Frodo goes off to the corner to hide, or perhaps he's coping
with a weak bladder.  Aragorn is off to the north waiting to be summoned should
trouble appear.</p>

<p class="initialCap">And speaking of trouble, the Witch King and four Ringwraiths approach
the ruined circle from the south.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Good is hampered by being unaware of the Ringwraiths until they
approach within 6" of the tower or use a magic power, or Good succeeds on a 50-50 dieroll at
the beginning of every turn.  I didn't roll on turn 1, just to be perverse.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Either side wins if the other abandons the circle (once the Ringwraiths
have entered), or (as usual) the Evil side can win by killing Frodo, or wounding him with the
Morgul Blade.  (So the "historical" result was an Evil win!)  If the Good side loses a hero but
banishes the Ringwraiths, it's a draw.</p>

<h3>Turns 1-2</h3>

<p><a href="Images/thIMG_1455.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1455.jpg" alt="Turn 2" title="Turn 2"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">The ringwraiths creep up the hill, getting into position.  The
hobbits remain oblivious for two turns.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turns 3</h3>

<p><a href="Images/thIMG_1457.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1457.jpg" alt="Turn 3: Aragorn" title="Turn 3: Aragorn"></a></p>

<p><a href="Images/thIMG_1465.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1465.jpg" alt="Turn 3: West Nazgul" title="Turn 3: West Nazgul"></a></p>

<p><a href="Images/thIMG_1464.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1464.jpg" alt="Turn 3: East Nazgul" title="Turn 3: East Nazgul"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">The hobbits finally feel the presence of the ringwraiths on turn 3.
Getting priority, Merry, Sam, and Pippin grab flaming brands and fan out to protect Frodo,
who is still doing whatever it is he's doing in the corner.</p>

<p class="initialCap">After movement, the Ringwraiths peer through the arches and see
the "minor" hobbits, but decline to use their magic powers.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 4</h3>

<p><a href="Images/thIMG_1467.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1467.jpg" alt="Turn 4: Overview" title="Turn 4: Overview"></a></p>

<p><a href="Images/thIMG_1468.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1468.jpg" alt="Turn 4: Closeup" title="Turn 4: Closeup"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil wins priority and continues to manuever the ringwraiths to the
edge of the archway.  No point in entering it until all can go in at once! One wraith catches
sight of Frodo (though the camera doesn't) and attempts to <i>Compel</i> him into putting on the ring,
but rolls a '1' and Frodo shakes off the compulsion.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The hobbits close up a bit for protection, while Aragorn continues to
run up the hill.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turns 5</h3>

<p><a href="Images/thIMG_1474.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1474.jpg" alt="Turn 5: The Ringwraiths are Here!" title="Turn 5: The Ringwraiths are Here!"></a></p>

<p><a href="Images/thIMG_1476.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1476.jpg" alt="Turn 5: Aragorn is on the way" title="Turn 5: Aragorn is on the way"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good gets priority, but the hobbits, declining to charge the wraiths, have
nothing to do but gulp and await Aragorn's arrival.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The ringwraiths arrange themselves in the archways in preparation for
entry next turn.  Two wraiths try to <i>Compel</i> Frodo, and despite expending 2 Will to resist he
succumbs to the command, puts on the ring, and advances towards the enemy!</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 6</h3>

<p><a href="Images/thIMG_1478.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1478.jpg" alt="Turn 6: Ringwraith Attack" title="Turn 6: Ringwraith Attack"></a></p>

<p><a href="Images/thIMG_1481.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1481.jpg" alt="Turn 6: Aragorn is near" title="Turn 6: Aragorn is near"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil wins this important priority roll.  Two wraiths charge Pippin, another
goes for Sam.  The Witch King tries to <i>Compel</i> Merry out of the way (if the wraiths can get to Frodo,
they can win the game this turn) but fails, so he and the last wraith charge Merry instead.</p>

<p class="initialCap">With the hobbits engaged, Good has little to do.  Aragorn reaches the
top of the hill.  Frodo tries to take off the ring and succeeds; he then gulps heavily and charges
one of the wraiths attacking Pippin, hoping to help all the hobbits to survive this turn.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Under the fearsome assault of two wraiths, Merry dies.  Sam loses his
combat, too, but remains unwounded.  It turns out Pippin didn't need the help, because he wins
his combat and uses his brand to chase his opponent out of the circle.  Frodo wins his combat
and rolls a 6,6 to wound; with a piercing shriek, the nazgul disintegrates!</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 7</h3>

<p><a href="Images/thIMG_1482.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1482.jpg" alt="Turn 7" title="Turn 7"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good wins priority and tries to run with the momentum.  Aragorn enters the
circle.  Sam and Pippin try to charge the wraiths to prevent them from getting to Frodo, but both
fail their courage checks and run out of the ruins, leaving only Aragorn and Frodo between the
wraiths and victory.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Trying to clear the circle, the Witch King attempts to <i>Compel</i> Aragorn
and succeeds, but Aragorn spends 2 Will to resist and shakes off the command.  The Witch King
then charges Frodo.  Another wraith <i>Transfix</i>es Aragorn and charges him.  A third wraith charges
Frodo, and the remaining wraith tries to <i>Compel</i> Frodo, fails, and remains out of combat to
preserve Will.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Aragorn is wounded but recovers using 2 Fate.  Mighty Frodo beats his
two opponents, though he fails to wound.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 8</h3>

<p><a href="Images/thIMG_1486.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1486.jpg" alt="Turn 8" title="Turn 8"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil wins priority on the tie, but Aragorn uses his free Might point
to call a Heroic Action and shouts "With Me!" to rally the hobbits.  Pippin fails another courage
check and continues running away; Frodo cowers, while stout Sam and Aragorn charge three of the
wraiths.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Only one ringwraith is available to move.  It attempts to <i>Compel</i>
Frodo but yet again rolls a '1'.  It charges Sam in hopes that two wraiths can take him out.  Sam
does lose, but remains unscratched.  Aragorn wins, and uses a Might point to kill both of his
opponents.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turns 9-10</h3>

<p><a href="Images/thIMG_1490.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thIMG_1490.jpg" alt="Turn 9" title="Turn 9"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">With but two wraiths left, Evil has almost no chance of winning and
the following turns bear this out.  No <i>Compel</i> spell against Frodo succeeds, and Sam and Aragorn
mop up the wraiths.</p>

<p class="initialCap">However, since Merry was killed, the game is a draw.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Post-game Thoughts</h3>

<p class="initialCap">Much more interesting than the Ferry scenario.  Evil took a bad
hit losing a Ringwraith on the first turn of combat, as the 5 lost Will points could well
have been the difference between victory and defeat.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Aragorn seems to be crucial to Good victory.  I'm wondering now if
Evil should hold off until he arrives, drain his courage down to 2 or less, and only then enter
the circle?</p>

<p class="initialCap">Conversely, Good seems to have a hard time pulling out the win
because it's pretty easy to lose Merry and Pippin in combat.  In the early turns, you've only
got Sam to protect them.  So I think a draw is probably the most common result of this scenario.</p>
