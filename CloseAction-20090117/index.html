<h1>Hango, June 1743</h1>
    
<hr>
    
<p class="initialCap">
This game was a what-if action fought between the Swedes and Russians in the mid-18th century.
Mark Campbell ran the game using his <a href="http://www.clashofarms.com/close-act.html">Close
Action</a> rules.

<p class="initialCap">
I was running the 66-gun <i>Ingermanland</i> which, despite the Swedish-sounding name, was a Russian
ship.  Though nothing too impressive by Trafalgar standards, the Russian 66ers are amongst the bigger
ships in this Baltic battle.  For this scenario, only the Russian  <i>Svyatoi Aleksandr</i> (70) and Swedish
<i>Ulrika Eleanora</i> (74) and <i>Enighet</i> (70) have a heavier broadside.  (I note that the Swedish
<i>Gotha</i> is rated as 72, but has a lower LG rating than <i>Ingermanland</i> for some reason.)

<p class="initialCap">
So if the following commentary tends to be <i>Ingermanland</i>-centric, that's why.  Apologies to
those other participants whose stories might be more interesting - though I had a good time, I 
voluntarily moved just nineteen hexes during the entire 20-turn battle.  I think some of the faster Swedish
ships did that in just three or four turns.

<p class="initialCap">
Crew quality is D throughout.  Russian morale is mostly 3 with some 4s, Swedish mostly 4 with some 3s.

<h3>Initial Setup and Scatter</h3>

<p class="initialCap">
We began as usual in two parallel lines, the Swedes (in dark bases) to the left and the Russians (in light
bases) to the right.  The wind is coming from the left, so we're all sailing close hauled, with the Swedes
at Plain Sail (with the yellow vertical sail markers) and the Russians at Medium Sail (yellow markers on
the bow).

<p class="initialCap">
But the initial scatter did us no favors.  <i>Revel</i> and <i>Ingermanland</i>, the fifth and sixth ships
in the Russian line, have huge gaps in front of and behind them.  Fortunately the Swedes were far enough
away that we had time to redress the line.

<p class="initialCap">
The Russian plan was to have the van and rear squadrons fall to leeward and overlap the ends of the heavy
66s in the center.  The resulting formation should have had the center covering the gap between the other two
squadrons, somewhat like the layout of bricks in a wall.  Since the Swedes had the wind gauge, we knew they'd
come to us; when they tried to break our center line, the backup squadrons would then have raking opportunities.

<hr><!-- ======================================================================== -->

<h3>Turn 1</h3>

<p class="initialCap">
We had explicit orders for the first three turns to fall back a bit.  Our line looks in better shape already, though
<i>Revel</i> and <i>Ingermanland</i> still look lonely.

<br>

<hr><!-- ======================================================================== -->

<h3>Turns 2-3</h3>

<p class="initialCap">
By the end of turn three, the gaps in the Russian center had largely been addressed.  The Swedes were obviously looking
to outrun our van, and were succeeding in doing so.  Some ships may have fired this turn, but <i>Ingermanland</i>'s targets
were still a hex or two too far away to make shooting worthwhile.

<br>

<hr><!-- ======================================================================== -->

<h3>Turn 4</h3>

<p class="initialCap">
Now the action really began.  <i>Sk&aring;ne</i> -- the Swedish ship facing the upper right -- moved to cut our line just ahead
of <i>Revel</i>.  You can see our lead ships beginning to turn to avoid being raked.  At the time I remember hoping that both
<i>Revel</i> and <i>Ingermanland</i> between them would be able to put some serious damage on <i>Ulrika</i>, but we got no lucky
criticals...yet.

<br>

<hr><!-- ======================================================================== -->

<h3>Turn 5</h3>

<p class="initialCap">
Things continue to heat up as <i>Sk&aring;ne</i> zips through the Russian line.  The Swedes have an excellent position now.
Though <i>Gotha</i>, their lead ship, appears to have swung too far out, <i>Kronshadt</i> (2nd Russian ship) and <i>Revel</i> (on
the other side of the Swedish cut) are facing three enemy ships each.

<p class="initialCap">
Our center, having mostly dropped to Fighting Sail in the first turn or so, got an order to raise sails, so we did so.  At this point,
a quarter of the way into the game, <i>Ingermanland</i> has moved about half her total voluntary movement.

<p class="initialCap">
I initially plotted fire against <i>Frihet</i> to take advantage of the rake, but I got a gentle reminder that a half broadside against
the closer (and already damaged) <i>Ulrika</i> might be a better move, so I took that instead.

<p class="initialCap">

<br>

<hr><!-- ======================================================================== -->

<h3>Turn 6</h3>

<p class="initialCap">
I made another dummy mistake as I failed to note that the "WEAR PORT BROAD-REACHING" (I think I got that right) signal wasn't addressed
to all ships, it was only addressed to the van.  But my mistake was forgiven, so my P1P plot got changed to 3 and I maintained my place in
the line.  And here I was so proud of myself for figuring out what the signal meant!

<p class="initialCap">
Gunfire this turn began to see some real results.  Despite my switching fire to <i>Frihet</i>, <i>Ulrika</i> lost a rigging section,
and <i>Sk&aring;ne</i> and <i>Revel</i> each lost a hull section.

<p class="initialCap">

<br>

<hr><!-- ======================================================================== -->

<h3>Turn 7</h3>

<p class="initialCap">
I don't have many notes or recollections of turn 7.  <i>Sk&aring;ne</i> is in trouble, but the Swedes have a slight numerical advantage
of engaged ships.  With the rear squadrons moving up and the van squadrons heading towards the rear, a general compacting of the action
began around now.  Though things are still open at this point, the position later will become quite congested indeed.

<p class="initialCap">
<i>Ingermanland</i> took her first damage (two rigging, one hull) this turn.  Oh well, I couldn't stay pristine forever.

<p class="initialCap">

<br>
<hr><!-- ======================================================================== -->

<h3>Turn 8</h3>

<p class="initialCap">
Worried that I would run into <i>Revel</i> this turn, I plotted 1.  My worry was baseless, as <i>Revel</i> was smart enough to get the
heck of out there -- which meant it was <i>my</i> turn for fire from <i>Ulrika</i> and a rake from <i>Finland</i>.  Notwithstanding the
beating that I took (two each of hull, sailors, and rigging), this was a fun turn for me as my rake on <i>Frihet</i> downed a rigging section
and set her on fire.  I realize that it's absurd to be proud of a lucky die roll, especially one made by the gamemaster and not me.
But I was.

<p class="initialCap">
In other fun damage assessment, 60-gun Swedish <i>Pommern</i> was up against our 66-gun flagship <i>Svyatoi Piotr</i>, and lost a
hull section this turn.  <i>Sk&aring;ne</i> lost a crew section and failed the resulting morale check to drop to E morale.
It's always nice to have an enemy ship take the shooting penalty for a lower-than-D crew, and each morale drop is one step closer to
striking....

<p class="initialCap">

<br>
<hr><!-- ======================================================================== -->

<h3>Turn 9</h3>

<p class="initialCap">
Wanting to avoid <i>Frihet</i> and hoping for a rake on <i>Finland</i>, I plotted 3.  I got my rake, but <i>Ulrika</i> beat me to
the last hex and so got a rake in turn against me.  I ended up ramming <i>Ulrika</i>, and though there was no fouling nor grappling,
I was at speed 0, and I never moved more than one hex per turn for the rest of the game.

<p class="initialCap">
In the center, you can see the cluster of ships forming. Things started to get hopelessly tangled.  <i>Sk&aring;ne</i> rammed
<i>Kronshtadt</i> and fouled her, unfortunately leaving <i>Sk&aring;ne</i> immobile while being bow raked.  At least it wasn't in
full-broadside position.

<p class="initialCap">
To the rear, note the Swedish <i>Bremen</i> about to cut off the Russian rear.  Nice move, though <i>Stockholm</i> (in the upper left
of the image) seems to be holding back.

<p class="initialCap">
<i>Ingermanland</i> took a bruising this turn, losing one rigging section and most of another, plus a hull section.  The resulting morale
check had me joining the "E"cho Morale Club, too.

<p class="initialCap">
As a small consolation, between <i>Ingermanland</i> and <i>Revel</i> we managed to knock off a rigging and two crew sections of
<i>Finland</i>.  Elsewhere, <i>Sk&aring;ne</i> lost another hull section, and <i>Kronshtadt</i> lost a hull and a rigging section.

<p class="initialCap">

<br>

<hr><!-- ======================================================================== -->

<h3>Turn 10</h3>

<p class="initialCap">
I tried to move P to avoid getting raked again, but <i>Frihet</i> came up and denied me the hex.

<p class="initialCap">
This was a good turn for the Russians.  <i>Revel</i> set <i>Finland</i> on fire, and section losses caused morale checks that dropped
<i>Sk&aring;ne</i> and <i>Finland</i> to F morale and <i>Pommern</i> to E.

<p class="initialCap">
My fears of being literally between two fires ended as <i>Frihet</i> finally succeeded in putting her fire out.  But that was little
consolation compared to the beating that I took this turn.  I lost a hull section, my second and most of my third rigging sections,
and a lot of sailors.

<p class="initialCap">
(The white Othello markers are ships which might drift.)

<br>

<hr><!-- ======================================================================== -->

<h3>Turn 11</h3>

<p class="initialCap">
I didn't want to foul anyone, and I was happy raking <i>Finland</i>, so I just plotted 0 for this turn.  I'm glad our flagship didn't
try to move the extra hex.

<p class="initialCap">
Note again how the Swedes have twelve ships engaged compared to only eleven Russians.  It's a small advantage, but possibly telling.
See also how the situation continues to compact.

<p class="initialCap">
Gunnery honors went to the Swedes this turn, as though <i>Sk&aring;ne</i> lost a rigging section (more or less immaterial since she was
going nowhere anyway), while <i>Revel</i> lost a hull and rigging section, and failed the subsequent morale check to join Club Echo.

<br>

<hr><!-- ======================================================================== -->

<h3>Turn 12</h3>

<p class="initialCap">
I see from my notes that I plotted 0 again, but that seems an odd move with <i>Piotr</i> just behind me.  (<i>Ingermanland</i> has turned
because of drift at the end of Turn 11).  I'm not sure why I thought that was a safe plot -- was <i>Piotr</i> fouled or grappled?  My
memory fails me now.

<p class="initialCap">
I lost my third rigging this turn, leaving me practically immobile.  Other Russian losses included <i>Severnyi Oryol</i> losing
a hull and rigging section, <i>Revel</i> losing a crew section (a failing the morale check to drop to F morale).  The Swedes saw
<i>Pommern</i> and <i>Bremen</i> each lose a hull section, with one of them (my notes are unclear) falling to E morale.  <i>Stockholm</i>
fell to F morale, I'm not sure why.

<br>

<hr><!-- ======================================================================== -->

<h3>Turn 13</h3>

<p class="initialCap">
With so little rigging at this point I had few movement options. I plotted P this turn, hoping to get away from the still-burning
<i>Finland</i>.  My big fear was that either we would get fouled and I'd catch fire, too, or that <i>Finland</i> would explode and I'd
be too close.

<p class="initialCap">
Looking back at the logs, my fear was somewhat misplaced as this was the last turn that I took any damage until near the end of the game.

<p class="initialCap">
The Swedes won the gun battle again this turn, with the <i>Sk&aring;ne</i>'s rudder getting destroyed and <i>Frederica Amalia</i> losing
a rigging section, while the Russians saw <i>Kronshtadt</i> losing a crew and rigging section, and <i>Osnovanie Blagopoluchiya</i> (it
just rolls off the tongue, doesn't it?) losing a hull section.

<p class="initialCap">

<br>

<hr><!-- ======================================================================== -->

<h3>Turn 14</h3>

<p class="initialCap">
I moved one hex ahead to get the bow rake on <i>Finland</i>.  Though my sails were shredded, I had most of my hull and guns and was
hence still doing some respectable gunnery.

<p class="initialCap">
This was a bloody turn.  On the Swedish side, <i>Vastermanland</i> and <i>Prins Wilhelm</i> lost hull sections, <i>Finland</i> lost a rigging
section, and <i>Bremen</i> lost a crew section and dropped to E morale.  For the Russians, <i>Kronshtadt</i> dropped to F morale,
while poor <i>Revel</i> lost a crew, rigging, hull, <i>and</i> marine section.

<p class="initialCap">
At the end of the turn, <i>Revel</i> was forced to make five morale checks.  Since she was at morale F, all it took was two failures to
force her to strike.  Beating the odds, she passed all five MCs, and continued to fight on.

<p class="initialCap">

<br>

<hr><!-- ======================================================================== -->

<h3>Turn 15</h3>

<p class="initialCap">
The general compacting of the battlefield continues.

<p class="initialCap">
In the gunnery phase, I notice that I took the half-broadside rake on adjacent <i>Finland</i>.  In light of what was to come, I probably
should've shot at approaching <i>Enighet</i> instead.

<p class="initialCap">
This turn the shot fell in favor of the Russians.  At the cost of <i>Astrakhan</i> losing a hull section and dropping to E morale, we
inflicting rigging and crew section losses on <i>Vastermanland</i>, rigging, hull, and crew section losses on <i>Finland</i>, a rigging
section loss on <i>Wilhelm</i>, and hull and rigging section losses on <i>Bremen</i> with resulting drop to F morale.

<p class="initialCap">
This was <i>Finland</i>'s fifth turn on fire. I think she had gone from wanting to put it out to wanting it to spread, in hopes of blowing
up and taking a lot of Russians (including <i>Ingermanland</i>) with her.  However, she put the fire out this turn.  It didn't help her much,
though, as the morale checks she had to take forced her to strike.

<br>

<hr><!-- ======================================================================== -->

<h3>Turn 16</h3>

<p class="initialCap">
Happy to let <i>Enighet</i> come to me, and with no further fear of <i>Finland</i>, I plotted 0.

<p class="initialCap">
I personally had a huge morale boost from last turn, as I thought we had turned the battle around and my battered ship was still in play.
But <i>Revel</i>'s luck finally ran out and she struck.  Other Russian losses were a hull section from <i>Piotr</i> and a rigging section
from <i>Astrakhan</i>.  In return we shot two hull sections and a crew section from <i>Wilhelm</i>; by the time the critical hits were
resolved she was forced to take six morale checks, which Mark thought was a <i>Close Action</i> record.  With a bit of bad luck on her part,
she might have struck right then and there, but she failed only two and so dropped to F morale.

<p class="initialCap">
(Sorry, no overall image for this turn.)

<br>

<hr><!-- ======================================================================== -->

<h3>Turn 17</h3>

<p class="initialCap">
I again plotted zero, but <i>Enighet</i> manuevered smartly to avoid the rake.

<p class="initialCap">
Our playing area now had 28 ships (two of them struck) in a playing area of 19 x 15 hexes.  At the beginning of the game, the
equivalent area would have had 4 ships.

<p class="initialCap">
Gunnery favored the Swedes.  <i>Gotha</i> lost a crew section due to a critical hit, but we lost crew sections from <i>Piotr</i>
and <i>Astrakhan</i>, and rigging sections from <i>Kronshtadt</i> and <i>Slava</i>.

<br>

<hr><!-- ======================================================================== -->

<h3>Turn 18</h3>

<p class="initialCap">
I remember a lot of discussion of past plots and possible speeds with neighboring ships, since there was a great possibility of
a collision.  In the end, I decided to plot 0 again.  My gunnery duel with <i>Enighet</i> continued.

<p class="initialCap">
Gunnery was about even this turn.  <i>Kronshtadt</i> and <i>Slava</i> lost hull sections, while <i>Hessen-Cassel</i> lost hull, rigging,
and crew sections.

<br>

<hr><!-- ======================================================================== -->

<h3>Turns 19 and 20</h3>

<p class="initialCap">
I plotted S for turn 19.  I remember hearing some advice about not turning your stern to the enemy, but it seemed to me that
I was possibly facing a stern rake if both <i>Enighet</i> and I stayed in place, but I was <i>definitely</i> facing a rake if I didn't
maneuver.  At any rate, <i>Enighet</i> obliged by moving away from my stern, and our gunnery duel continued.

<p class="initialCap">
I ended up losing my second hull section, and dropping to F morale.  That would have been more demoralizing if I hadn't been happy to
still be in the battle.  Of more importance, battered <i>Kronshtadt</i> finally struck as result of five morale checks taken this turn.

<p class="initialCap">
Unfortunately, I neglected to take any pictures for turn 20.  Gunnery again slightly favored the Swedes on that turn, as they lost two
sections compared to three Russian sections, with our flagship <i>Piotr</i> falling to F morale.

<hr><!-- ======================================================================== -->

<h3>Wrapup</h3>

<p class="initialCap">
I think the finally consensus was that the Swedes won, though I'd be interested in seeing the final VP calculations to get a real sense
of the magnitude of the victory.

<p class="initialCap">
All agreed that the scenario was very well balanced and made for a fun game.

<p class="initialCap">
Personally, I had a great time and look forward to playing again.
