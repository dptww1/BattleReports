<h1>The Banks of the Harnen</h1>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<p class="initialCap">This scenario for Games Workshop's "Lord of the Rings" miniatures game
comes from the <i>Pelennor Fields</i> supplement.  In it, a squad of Haradrim face off against
a squad of Gondorians, each with a captain and a banner bearer.  So it's a pretty straightforward
battle, with some additional interest provided by the victory conditions; each side gets a point
for every casualty caused, plus Harad gets a bonus point for every figure on the north bank of
the river Harnen at the end of turn 12.  But if Gondor can keep all the Haradrim south of the river
at that point, they get a ten-point bonus.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Casualties return to play on the next turn from the friendly board edge.
This means that Haradrim spearmen killed after turn 8 are effectively eliminated from the game,
as they don't have enough time to cross the river before the game ends. (Haradrim bowmen can,
of course, continue to attempt to inflict casualties with arrows.)</p>

<p class="initialCap">None of this represents any specific scene in the books or the movie.
Ordinarily I prefer to stick to historical (as it were) scenarios, but this one seems innocuous
enough, as there must have been many clashes like this between Gondor and the Southrons over the
course of the Third Age.  Plus, it gives me a chance to put my new Haradrim and as-yet unused
Gondorians into action.</p>

<h3>Setup</h3>

<p>
<a href="Images/Img_3888.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thImg_3888.jpg" alt="Evil Troops" title="Evil Troops"></a>

<a href="Images/Img_3889.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thImg_3889.jpg" alt="Good Troops" title="Good Troops"></a>

<a href="Images/Img_3890.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thImg_3890.jpg" alt="Good Troops" title="Good Troops"></a>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">The Haradrim force is a Chieftain, a Banner Bearer, 12 bowmen, and 11 spearmen.  The Gondorians
have a Captain, a Banner Bearer, 8 bowmen, 8 swordsmen with shields, and 7 spearmen.</p>

<p class="initialCap">It may seem that the Haradrim are superior in archery, but the Gondorians are twice
as hard to wound, due to their armor.  So on average per turn we should see 6 Haradrim hits, one of which actually
kills, compared to 4 Gondorian hits with one and a third kills.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Gondorians deploy first, and with no idea how the enemy will set up, use a balanced
formation, with the Captain and Banner Bearer somewhat protected by the line troops.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Haradrim set up on Gondor's left flank, with the idea of pulling the Gondorians toward
the board edge, and then re-entering casualties near the other edge, forcing the Gondorians to split to meet the
multiple threats.</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 1</h3>

<p><a href="Images/Img_3891.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thImg_3891.jpg" alt="Turn 1" title="Turn 1"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">As always, Good automatically gets Priority on turn 1.  The Good troops shift to their left
to deal with the main crossing, the bowmen lagging a bit so that they can fire.  The Haradrim make a half-move
to the river for similar reasons.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Shoot Phase shows why statistics are only a guide to what will <i>probably</i> happen,
as the Gondorians fail to inflict any casualties at all, while the Haradrim arrows find gaps in the armor of
two swordsmen.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Casualties: Good 2, Evil 0</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 2</h3>

<p><a href="Images/Img_3892.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thImg_3892.jpg" alt="Turn 2" title="Turn 2"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority.  Both sides continue their movements, with last turn's Good casualties
off in the background.</p>

<p class="initialCap">The Shoot Phase again defies the odds, as while Harad gets the expected one kill,
six of the eight Gondorian bowmen hit their marks, and yet all of them fail to kill their targets!</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evidently the Southrons availed themselves of some pretty heavy anti-arrow magic.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Casualties: Good 3, Evil 0</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 3</h3>

<p><a href="Images/Img_3894.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thImg_3894.jpg" alt="Turn 3" title="Turn 3"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority.  Gondor nearly has the river bank covered, so Harad takes the half move
and continues the shooting.  After all, it's been working so far.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Good finally kills two spearmen, while Harad takes down another swordsman.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Casualties: Good 4, Evil 2</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 4</h3>

<p><a href="Images/Img_3898.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thImg_3898.jpg" alt="Turn 4" title="Turn 4"></a></p>

<p><a href="Images/Img_3897.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thImg_3897.jpg" alt="Turn 4" title="Turn 4"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority on an uneventful turn that has no casualties at all.  Last turn's
Haradrim casualties enter on the opposite edge of the battlefield from the main action, hoping to draw away some
enemy men.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Next turn is bound
to be bloody though, as the Haradrim will be on the north bank of the river.  Can the Gondorians clear them out?</p>

<p class="initialCap">Casualties: Good 4, Evil 2</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 5</h3>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority as the melee begins. Gondor finally inflicts more casualties than she suffers
in losses.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Casualties: Good 7, Evil 7</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 6</h3>

<p><a href="Images/Img_3903.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thImg_3903.jpg" alt="Turn 6, West" title="Turn 6, West"></a></p>

<p><a href="Images/Img_3902.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thImg_3902.jpg" alt="Turn 6, East" title="Turn 6, East"></a></p>

<p><a href="Images/Img_3905.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thImg_3905.jpg" alt="Turn 6, Harad Chieftain" title="Turn 6, Harad Chieftain"></a></p>
<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority.  The swirling melee continues, with Gondor focusing on the Haradrim
Chieftain, on the banks of the river.  The combat roll is in Good's favor, 6-4, but the Chieftain has
two points of Might.  Should he use them to win the battle?  If he doesn't there's a small chance that
he'd be wounded to death this turn.  In the end I decided that on a roll of 1 or 2 he would use both
Might points, and I rolled a '2'.  Because of his higher Fight value, the Chieftain then wins the tied
combat, and together with some other Haradrim victories, Evil again pulls ahead in the point count.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Casualties: Good 11, Evil 10</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 7</h3>

<p><a href="Images/Img_3908.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thImg_3908.jpg" alt="Turn 7, West" title="Turn 7, West"></a></p>

<p><a href="Images/Img_3907.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thImg_3907.jpg" alt="Turn 7, East" title="Turn 7, East"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority.  The Chieftain rushes the Gondor Banner Bearer and even kills him,
but an adjacent spearman picks up the banner.  Elsewhere Good knocks off two more Haradrim and the score
is again even.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Casualties: Good 12, Evil 12</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 8</h3>

<p><a href="Images/Img_3912.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thImg_3912.jpg" alt="Turn 8, West" title="Turn 8, West"></a></p>

<p><a href="Images/Img_3910.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thImg_3910.jpg" alt="Turn 8, East" title="Turn 8, East"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority again.  The Gondor Captain calls for a Heroic move, which enables most of the troops in the
east to engage an enemy of their choice, while doubling up on the Chieftain and Banner Bearer.  The Chieftain is wounded and
the Banner Bearer killed, but again an adjacent spearman picks up the fallen banner.  And that's about it for Good kills this
turn.  On the far right, two Haradrim are each outnumbered 2:1 by foes but win their combat anyway and even kill one opponent.
Two other Gondorians fall in the center.

<p class="initialCap">Casualties: Good 15, Evil 13</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 9</h3>

<p><a href="Images/Img_3915.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thImg_3915.jpg" alt="Turn 9" title="Turn 9"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority.  As if to make up for last turn, luck now entirely favors Gondor.  Gondorian arrows, which
haven't done anything in a number of turns, pick off a Haradrim warrior crossing the river.  The Chieftain is surrounded and
despite six strikes only one Wound is scored, but the Chieftain fails his Fate roll and down he goes.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil fails to inflict any casualties at all, though at least a few more troops are across the river or nearly
there.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Casualties: Good 15, Evil 17</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 10</h3>

<p><a href="Images/Img_3918.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thImg_3918.jpg" alt="Turn 10" title="Turn 10"></a></p>

<p><a href="Images/Img_3919.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thImg_3919.jpg" alt="Turn 10, Banner" title="Turn 10, Banner"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil Priority.  The Good Captain again calls a Heroic move so as to engage the Haradrim on the eastern flank
on their own terms.  In particular, the Banner Bearer must die.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Gondorian bows inflict two casualties.  The Southrons win more than their fair share of combats, but fail to
inflict any wounds.  But Gondor wins the crucial melee with Banner Bearer and down he goes, this time with no Haradrim warriors
adjacent to pick up the banner.  One other Haradrim dies in melee.</p>

<p class="initialCap">With two turns to go, things are looking grim for Evil.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Casualties: Good 15, Evil 21</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 11</h3>

<p><a href="Images/Img_3921.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thImg_3921.jpg" alt="Turn 11" title="Turn 11"></a></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority.  Now heavily outnumbering Harad on the eastern flank, Good moves to surround the remaining
units.  Evil arrows continue to bounce off armor, while between bows and combat Gondor manages to inflict seven casualties,
virtually clearing their left flank of potential Haradrim scoring troops.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Evil again fails to inflict any casualties.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Casualties: Good 15, Evil 28</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Turn 12</h3>

<p><a href="Images/Img_3923.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thImg_3923.jpg" alt="Turn 12, Harad bowmen" title="Turn 12, Harad bowmen"></a></p>

<p><a href="Images/Img_3924.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thImg_3924.jpg" alt="Turn 12, center" title="Turn 12, center"></a></p>

<p><a href="Images/Img_3925.jpg"><img src="Thumbnails/thImg_3925.jpg" alt="Turn 12, Harad holdout" title="Turn 12, Harad holdout"></a></p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="initialCap">Good Priority.  Just to show the swings of luck possible, this turn all eight Gondorian bowmen miss entirely (yep,
eight consecutive hit rolls of 1-3).  The Haradrim bowmen manage 3 kills in return.</p>

<p class="initialCap">But it's not enough.  Symbolically, the easternmost Haradrim that has been fighting outnumbered
and yet still holding out since turn 6 finally succumbs, as the only casualty inflicted by Good this turn.</p>

<p class="initialCap">But it's not enough.  Gondor scores the 10 point bonus for clearing the northern bank of the Harnen.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Casualties: Good 18, Evil 29</p>

<p class="initialCap">Final Score: Good 39, Evil 18</p>

<p><br></p>

<hr><!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3>Post-game Thoughts</h3>

<p class="initialCap">Well, that wasn't particularly close.</p>

<p class="initialCap">However, it wasn't until I began this write up that I remembered the poisoned weapons of the Haradrim.
This allows them to reroll any Wound die of 1.  I don't keep detailed enough records to know exactly how much effect this rule
would have had on this game, but it's hard to imagine it making enough of a difference given the huge margin of victory.</p>

<p class="initialCap">As Evil, I also hurt my chances by focusing too much on shooting.  It's imperative to get troops
across the river so that someone -- anyone! -- survives on turn 12 to prevent the Gondor scoring bonus.  So moving reinforcements
at half moves so that they can take potshots probably contributed to the lopsidedness of the Good victory.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Losing all the Evil Hero's might in one fell swoop hurt, too.  I maybe should have taken my chances that
he'd survive the combat.</p>

<p class="initialCap">A final thought on balance is the width of the river.  This counts as difficult terrain, doubling the
cost to move through it.  My river appears to be as wide as called for by the scenario, but in practice this width really
hurts the Haradrim.  Any Haradrim spearmen killed after turn 7 becomes irrelevant because even though he can re-enter the game,
he can't get across the river by turn 12.  I might impose the difficult terrain penalty only on the deepest part of the river
next time.</p>

<p class="initialCap">Worth a replay, I think. But it's odd that Gondor's scoring and defense advantage is not
countered by giving the Haradrim more troops.</p>
